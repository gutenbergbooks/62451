<h2>Translator&rsquo;s Preface</h2>
<p>Upon the titlepage of the original of this
little volume stands inscribed, &ldquo;A life
picture for German youth and the German
people.&rdquo; It might, with equal pertinency,
have been written, &ldquo;A life picture for all youth and
all people.&rdquo; Emperor William First was a delicate
child, but was so carefully nurtured and trained that
he became one of the most vigorous men in Germany.
At an early age he manifested a passionate
interest in everything pertaining to war. In his
youth he received the Iron Cross for bravery. He
served under his father in the final wars of the
Napoleonic campaign, and in his twenty-third year
mastered not only the military system of Germany,
but those of other European countries. During the
revolutionary period of 1848 he was cordially hated
by the Prussian people, who believed that he was
wedded to the policy of absolutism, but before many
years he was the idol of all his kingdom, and in the
great war with France (1870), all Germans rallied
round him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</div>
<p>After the close of this war he returned
to Berlin and spent the remainder of his days in
peace, the administration of internal affairs being left
largely to his great coadjutor, Prince Bismarck. In
connection with Von Moltke, these two, the Iron
Emperor and the Iron Chancellor, made Germany
the leading power of Europe. In simpleness of
life, honesty of character, devotion to duty, love of
country, and splendor of achievement, the Emperor
William&rsquo;s life is a study for all youth and all
people.</p>

<h2>Emperor William First</h2>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">Chapter I</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Early Life</span></h2>
<p>King Frederick William Second was still
upon the throne of Prussia when his
son and successor, afterward Frederick
William Third, was married to the lovely
Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The
memory of this noble pair is treasured in every
Prussian heart, and their self-sacrificing devotion
to the people, their benevolence and piety, will
serve as a shining example for all time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>On the fifteenth of October, 1795, a son was born
to them, the future King Frederick William Fourth,
and on the twenty-second of March, 1797, the Crown
Princess gave birth to a second son, whose name
was destined to be inscribed in golden letters in
the book of the world&rsquo;s history. Although a handsome
boy, his health was so delicate as to cause his
parents much anxiety, and it seems almost like a
special dispensation of Providence that he should
have lived to an age far beyond that usually allotted
to the fate of mortals.</p>
<p>On the third of April the christening took place
in the Crown Prince&rsquo;s palace. Chief Councillor
of the Consistory Sack stood before the altar, which
was ablaze with lighted tapers, and ranged before
him in a wide semicircle were the priests, the
Crown Prince, and the godparents. Others present
were the King and Queen; the widowed Princess
Louise, a sister of the Crown Princess and
afterward Queen of Hanover; Princes Henry and
Ferdinand of Prussia, brothers of Frederick the
Great, with their wives; Princes Henry and William,
brothers of the Crown Prince; their sister, the Electress
of Hesse-Cassel; Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt,
and the hereditary prince Frederick
William of Orange. Proxies had been sent by
the Czar and Czarina of Russia, Prince William
of Nassau, the Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt, and
the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel. The principal
governess, Countess Voss, handed the child to the
King, who held him during the ceremony. He
received the names Frederick William Louis, with
the understanding that William was the one by
which he should be known.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>On the sixteenth of November of that same year
Frederick William Second was gathered to his forefathers,
and the father of our hero ascended the
throne of Prussia. Their assumption of royal
honors made no change in the simplicity of the
august pair&rsquo;s affection for each other or their devotion
to their children, and whenever time and
opportunity permitted, they gladly laid aside the
oppressive form and ceremony of the court for
the pure and simple pleasures of home life. Every
morning and evening they went hand in hand to
the nursery to enjoy the growth and development
of their children, or, bending with loving caresses
over their cradles, committed them to the fatherly
care of the Almighty. The simple cradle with its
little green curtains in which Prince William dreamed
away his infancy is still preserved in the Hohenzollern
Museum at the Monbijou Palace, a touching
reminder of the delicate child who was afterward
to be so famous and to serve as an instrument for
the fulfilment of the mighty decrees of Providence
for the welfare of his people.</p>

<p>The early years of Prince William&rsquo;s life passed
happily and peacefully by. Watched over with
tenderest love and care by his noble parents, their
devotion and piety, their readiness to sacrifice themselves
for each other or for their people, their
prompt and cheerful fulfilment of duty, and the
courage that never failed them even in the darkest
hours, all made a deep impression on the child&rsquo;s
sensitive nature and helped to form the character
that distinguished the heroic Emperor up to the
last days and hours of his life.</p>
<p>There was little prospect at that time of William&rsquo;s
ever wielding the sceptre, for his elder brother was
a strong, healthy lad, and the crown seemed in all
human probability likely to descend to him and his
heirs. It was important, therefore, for the younger
son to choose some vocation which would enable
him to be of use to the Fatherland and prove himself
worthy of his illustrious ancestors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>The Prince&rsquo;s devoted tutor, Johann Friedrich
Gottlieb Delbr&uuml;ck, carefully fed his mind with the
history and glories of the house of Brandenburg,
a study of which he never tired and to which
he applied himself with untiring zeal. Learning
from this that a well-disciplined standing army,
firmly supported by public sentiment, was the first
and most important requisite for the advancement
and maintenance of the monarchy, he determined
to devote himself to a military career and use all
his energy to fit himself for that high and difficult
calling, that he might furnish a stout support to
his brother&rsquo;s throne. But he had shown a natural
fondness for soldiers at an early age, long before
arriving at this maturer resolution, an inclination
which his father had carefully encouraged. The
two little Princes, with their cousin Frederick,
son of the deceased Prince Louis, received their
first military instruction in Potsdam from a noncommissioned
officer of the first Battalion of the
Guard, named Bennstein, and in Berlin from Sergeant
Major Cleri of the M&ouml;llendorf Regiment.
The King was often present at these exercises to
note their progress, praise or criticise, and as a
reward for their industry, arranged a delightful
surprise for them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>It was Christmas Eve of the year 1803. In the
royal palace at Berlin the lighted Christmas-tree
glittered and sparkled, its branches bending with
the weight of gifts provided by the royal parents
for their children. All was silent, for the family
were still at divine service, with which they always
began the celebration of the holy festival. Suddenly
the clear stroke of a bell sounded through the quiet
room, the great doors flew open as if of their own
accord, and the King and Queen entered with their
excited children. A perfect sea of light streamed
toward them from the huge tree that towered
almost to the ceiling and filled the air with its
spicy fragrance, while red-cheeked apples and gilded
nuts nodded a friendly greeting from its branches.
Here the beautiful Louise, Prussia&rsquo;s beloved Queen,
reigned supreme, gayly distributing gifts and enjoying
the delight of her precious children, while the
King stood quietly by, his eyes shining with fatherly
happiness. All at once the six-year-old William
gave a shout of joy. Before him, carefully tucked
away under the boughs of the tree, he saw a gay
little uniform. What joy! what bliss! The red
dolman with its white cords and lacings, the blue
furred jacket, the bearskin cap, and the sabre filled
his cup of happiness to overflowing, and the happy
little fellow could find no words to thank the kind
parents who had so unexpectedly granted his heart&rsquo;s
desire. It was the uniform of the Rudorff Regiment,
now the Ziethen Hussars, and the Christ-child
had brought his brother, the Crown Prince,
that of the body-guard, and his cousin Frederick
that of a dragoon. The next morning the three
boys dressed up in their new costumes and the
delighted father presented them to the Queen as
the youngest recruits in his army. But none of
them was so proud as William, and very fine he
looked in his first soldierly dress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>Two years later he saw the uhlan regiment
Towarczysz, at that time the only one in Prussia,
and was so charmed with its singular uniform
that he begged his father for one like it. The
King, always ready to encourage his military tastes,
granted his wish, and from that time he alternated
between a uhlan and a hussar. That year he also
saw the famous old dragoon regiment Ansbach-Baireuth
of which the Queen was commander, and
the sight of his mother in her regimental colors
made a deep impression upon him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Though he was passionately devoted to soldiering,
childish sports and games were not neglected,
especially during the Summer, when the royal family
went for a few weeks to their country place at
Paretz. Here the King and Queen encouraged
their children to associate freely with all classes&mdash;from
the village children to future army officers at
military schools. It was naturally among the latter
that the Princes found most of their playmates.
The knowledge of the people he gained in this
way proved a great and lasting benefit to Prince
William.</p>
<p>Thus happily and peacefully, surrounded by luxury
and splendor, watched over with tenderest care,
our hero&rsquo;s life slipped by till the end of his eighth
year, when a storm burst over the country that shook
the Prussian throne to its foundations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">Chapter II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A Hard School</span></h2>
<p>The throne of France was occupied at
that time by the insatiable Napoleon I.
Born on the island of Corsica, the son of
an advocate, he entered the French army
during the Revolution and rose step by step until
by his remarkable talents and ability he attained
the highest honors of state. His ambition was to
make France mistress of the world, and aided by the
blind devotion of the people he seemed in a fair way
of realizing this dream, for one country after another
succumbed with astonishing rapidity to his victorious
legions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>Prussia was spared for some time, but in 1806
King Frederick William Third, unable for his
own honor or that of his country longer to endure
Napoleon&rsquo;s aggressions, was reluctantly forced to
declare war, and the country&rsquo;s doom was sealed.
Deluded by the traditions of former glories under
the great Frederick, the army and its leaders thought
it would prove an easy task for the battalions that
had once withstood the onset of half Europe to
protect the frontiers of the Fatherland against the
Corsican conqueror, but disaster followed swiftly.
The guns of Jena and Auerst&auml;dt scattered those
golden mists of self-delusion and betrayed with
startling clearness the degeneracy of the military
organization, which, like the machine of government,
bore little trace of Frederick the Great&rsquo;s
influence save in outward forms.</p>
<p>The defeat of October 14, 1806, decided the fate
of Prussia. Like a roaring sea the French swept
over the country, and two days later it became necessary
for the safety of the royal children to remove
them from Berlin. Their nearest refuge was the
castle at Schwedt on the Oder, where their mother
joined them, prepared to share with her darlings the
cruel fate that had befallen them. Sitting with her
two eldest sons and their tutor Delbr&uuml;ck that evening,
she spoke those stirring words that proved
such a help and inspiration to Emperor William in
after years.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;In one day,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have seen destroyed
a structure which great and good men have labored
for two hundred years to build up. There is no
longer a Prussian kingdom, no longer an army, nor
a national honor. Ah, my sons, you are already
old enough to appreciate the calamity that has overtaken
us. In days to come, when your mother
is no longer living, think of these unhappy times
and weep in memory of the tears I now am shedding.
But do not weep only! Work, work with all your
strength! You yet may prove the good geniuses
of your country. Wipe out its shame and humiliation,
restore the tarnished glory of your house as
your ancestor, the great Elector, avenged at Fehrbellin
his father&rsquo;s disgraceful defeat in Sweden! Do
not allow yourselves to be influenced by the degeneracy
of the age! Be men, and strive to attain the
glorious fame of heroes! Without such aims you
would be unworthy the name of Prussian princes,
successors of the great Frederick; but if all your
efforts are powerless to uplift your fallen country,
then seek death as Prince Louis Ferdinand sought
it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>Their stay in Schwedt was but a short one.
The rapid advance of the French army, driving
the retreating Prussians before them, compelled
the Queen and her children to flee to Dantzig
and K&ouml;nigsberg, where they would be safe for a
time at least. But what a journey it was! There
was no time to make any preparations for their
comfort. Day and night they pressed on, without
stopping to rest, in any kind of a vehicle that
could be obtained, over rough roads and through a
strange part of the country, often suffering from
hunger and thirst, their hearts full of sorrow and
anxiety for the beloved Fatherland.</p>
<p>Emperor William used to relate an incident
connected with this journey which makes a touching
picture of those dark days. &ldquo;While my
mother was fleeing with us from the French in
that time of tribulation,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we had the
misfortune to break one of the wheels of our coach,
in the middle of an open field. There was no
place for us to go, and we sat on the bank of a
ditch while the damage was being repaired as well
as possible. My brother and I were tired and
hungry, and much put out by the delay. I remember
that I especially, being rather a puny lad,
troubled my dear mother greatly with my complaints.
To divert our minds, she arose and, pointing
to the quantities of pretty blue flowers with
which the field was covered, told us to pick some
and bring them to her. Then she wove them into
wreaths as we eagerly watched her dexterous fingers.
As she worked, overcome with thoughts of her
country&rsquo;s sorrowful plight and her own danger and
anxiety for the future of her sons, the tears began
to drop slowly from her beautiful eyes upon the
cornflower wreaths. Smitten to the heart by her
distress and completely forgetting my own childish
troubles, I flung my arms about her neck and tried
to comfort her, till she smiled and placed the wreath
upon my head. Though I was only ten years old
at the time, this scene remains undimmed in my
memory, and after all these years I can still see
those blossoms all sparkling with my mother&rsquo;s
tears, and that is why I love the cornflower better
than any other flower.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic2">

<p class="caption"><i>The cornflower wreaths</i></p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>At K&ouml;nigsberg the Queen was attacked with a
fever, but this did not prevent her from continuing
her flight to Memel with her children in January,
1807. It seemed doubtful at one time if she
would live to get there, but she insisted upon pressing
on, through cold and storm, ill as she was.
Once, almost at the point of death, she was forced
to spend the night in a poor peasant&rsquo;s hut, without
proper food or covering, the freezing wind blowing
through the broken windowpanes and scattering
snowflakes on her wretched cot. But God did not
forsake the heroic Queen, and she succeeded at last
in reaching Memel, there to await the no longer
doubtful issue of the war, which cost Frederick
William Third half of his kingdom. This sudden
change from peace and prosperity to deepest humiliation
was the anvil on which Providence forged
the sword that was one day to make Germany a
united and powerful nation, and some words of the
Queen&rsquo;s, written at this time to her father, are significant
and memorable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It may be well for our children to have learned the
serious side of life while they are young. Had they grown
up surrounded by ease and luxury, they would have accepted
such things as a matter of course; that must always
be so. But alas! their father&rsquo;s anxious face and their
mother&rsquo;s tears have taught them otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Our hero was ten years old when the King was
forced to sign the disastrous peace of Tilsit, and according
to the usual custom he was raised at this
age to the rank of officer. The great event should
properly have taken place March 22, 1807, but
owing to the unsettled state of the country his
father presented him with his appointment on New
Years&rsquo; Day, just before the royal family left K&ouml;nigsberg
for Memel, and he was made ensign in the
newly formed regiment of foot-guards. At Christmas
he was advanced to a second-lieutenantship,
and on June 21, 1808, marched with his regiment
back to K&ouml;nigsberg. A report made about this
time states: &ldquo;Prince William, during his first two
years of service with the Prussian infantry, has become
familiar with every detail of army life and is
already heart and soul a soldier,&rdquo;&mdash;a tribute well
deserved by the young officer, for he was faithful
and industrious and devoted to his profession. The
two following years that the royal family remained in
K&ouml;nigsberg were an important period in the life of
Prince William. The sole tuition of Delbr&uuml;ck no
longer satisfied the Queen, and on the advice of
Baron von Stein, she appointed General Diericke
and Colonel Gaudy as governors for the Crown
Prince, and Major von Pirch and Professor Reimann
for Prince William. At the same time Karl
August Zeller, a pupil of the Queen&rsquo;s honored
Swiss teacher Pestalozzi, was summoned to K&ouml;nigsberg
and given charge of the school system. He
also assisted in the education of Prince William,
whose untiring zeal and industry caused him to
make steady and rapid progress in all branches
of learning. His best efforts, however, were given
to his military duties, and he eagerly treasured up
everything that was said at court of famous generals
and heroes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>On November 12, 1808, he paraded for the first
time with his regiment. In September of the
following year he was present at the placing of the
memorial tablets to the first East Prussian Infantry
in the palace chapel at K&ouml;nigsberg, and after the
court had returned to Berlin, he entered that city
with his regiment on his parents&rsquo; wedding anniversary,
December 24, 1809. It was a melancholy
home-coming, and never again did our hero make so
sad an entry into his capital, for in spite of the joy
with which the citizens welcomed the return of
their beloved sovereigns once more, the country&rsquo;s
shameful bondage under the yoke of Napoleon lay
heavily on all hearts. No one felt the disgrace more
keenly than Queen Louise, however: it rankled in
her bosom and gradually consumed her strength
till her health began to give way under it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>In the Summer of 1810 she visited her father at
Strelitz, whither the King soon followed her, and it
was decided to make a long stay at the ducal castle
of Hohenzieritz, hoping the change and rest might
benefit the Queen. Soon after her arrival, she was
taken seriously ill with an acute attack of asthma,
but recovered sufficiently by the first of July for
the King to return to Charlottenburg, where the
royal family were then in the habit of spending
the Summer. For some days she seemed much
better, but the attacks of pain and suffocation soon
returned, and on the nineteenth of July the King
hastened back to Hohenzieritz, where he found his
wife fully conscious but so altered in appearance
that he was forced to leave the room, weeping aloud.
As soon as he had recovered his self-control he
returned to the Queen, who laid her hand in his
with the question:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you bring any one with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Fritz and William,&rdquo; replied the King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, God! what joy!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Let them be
brought to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two boys came in and knelt beside their
mother&rsquo;s bed. &ldquo;My Fritz, my William!&rdquo; she murmured
repeatedly. Soon the paroxysms seized her
again, the children were led away weeping bitterly,
and soon afterward the King closed forever those
eyes that had been the light of his life&rsquo;s dark pathway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>The death of their beloved Queen turned all
Prussia into a house of mourning, so deeply did
the sorrowful news affect the hearts of her subjects.
Still deeper and more lasting, however, was the impression
made upon Prince William by the early
loss of his adored mother. All through his life her
memory was treasured as a holy image in his heart,
and to his latest days he never forgot her devotion
and self-sacrifice, or that nineteenth of July which
deprived him of a mother&rsquo;s care, his father of the
best of wives, and the nation of a noble sovereign
and benefactress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>The years passed on, but Prussia did not remain
in her deep humiliation, prostrate and powerless.
A new spirit began to awake, and through the efforts
of such men as Stein and Hardenberg, Scharnhorst
and Gneisenau, who nobly and without hope of reward
devoted themselves to the redemption of the
Fatherland, a feeling began to stir throughout the
country that the day of deliverance must come.
And it did come. Arrogant with his successes and
thirsting for fresh conquests, Napoleon in the year
1812 aspired to seize the mighty Russian Empire
and add it to his dependencies, but there a check
was placed on his victorious career. To be sure he
penetrated as far as Moscow, expecting to winter
there, but the Russians sacrificed their ancient capital
and Napoleon with his troops was driven from
the burning city out into the open country in the
depth of Winter. The Lord of Hosts seemed to
have allied himself with the Russians to destroy the
disturber of the peace of Europe, for the Winter
was an early and unusually severe one and Napoleon
was forced to order a retreat. And what a retreat
it was! Day after day, through the heavy snows
and the bitter cold, plodded the exhausted soldiers,
pursued and harried by the Russians like hunted
animals. Of the five hundred thousand men who
set out in all the proud assurance of victory, only a
few thousands returned again to France. It was a
bitter blow to the aspiring conqueror&mdash;God himself
had dealt out judgment to him! He hastily
collected together a new army, it is true, but now
all Germany was allied with Russia to defeat the
tyrant&rsquo;s schemes. The glorious war of 1813-1815
was about to begin.</p>
<p>Among those great men who had labored untiringly
to emancipate Prussia from the yoke of France,
the work of reorganizing the army had fallen chiefly
to Scharnhorst.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>It had been his idea to train the whole population
of the smaller outlying States in the use of
arms, and thus continually to introduce fresh forces
into the army of forty thousand men which Prussia
was allowed to support, to take the place of older
and well-disciplined regiments which were dismissed.
The news of Napoleon&rsquo;s disastrous experience in
Russia filled the Prussians with new hope and enthusiasm,
but the King was slow to determine on
any decisive action. Napoleon still had powerful
resources at his command, and if the struggle for
which the people clamored were to go against them,
the ruin of Prussia would be complete. Further
delay, however, became at last impossible, and on
January 22, 1813, Frederick William left Berlin,
where his personal safety was still menaced by
French troops, and removed the court to Breslau.
An alliance was concluded, February 28, between
Russia and Prussia, and on March 17 war was declared
against Napoleon. That same day General
Scharnhorst&rsquo;s ordinance in regard to the militia was
carried into effect and the large body of well-drilled
men which he had been quietly training for so long,
took their place in the newly formed army.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Shortly before this, on his deceased wife&rsquo;s birthday,
March 10, the King established the order of the
Iron Cross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With God for King and Fatherland!&rdquo; was the
watchword with which Prussia entered the struggle
that was to lift her to her old position of power and
independence or end in hopeless ruin. The King
issued a call for troops and the whole nation responded.
Not a man but would gladly die rather
than longer endure the shame of subjection. The
lofty spirit of their departed Queen seemed still to
inspire the hearts of the people, for they arrayed
themselves against the conqueror who had chosen
the heroes of Pagan antiquity for his models, with
a Christian faith and devotion rarely equalled in
the history of the world. Prince William too
longed with all his heart to take part in the liberation
of Prussia and with tears in his eyes besought
his father to allow him to take the field, but out
of regard for his son&rsquo;s health the King was obliged
to refuse his prayer, and he remained in Breslau, in
bitter discontent, anxiously waiting and hoping for
news from the seat of war, at that time so difficult
to obtain and so slow in arriving. Even his advance
to a first-lieutenantship in the course of the
summer failed to cheer him, for he felt that he had
done nothing to deserve it. But after the battle
of Leipzic, in which the French were routed and
driven back across the Rhine, the King returned
to Breslau and, handing the Prince a captain&rsquo;s commission,
placed on his shoulders with his own hands
the epaulettes then just introduced for army officers,
and told him to prepare to join the army. This
was joyful news indeed! On to France, on against
the foe that so long had held the Fatherland in
bondage and sent his adored mother to a premature
grave! His heart beat high with pride and courage,
and he could hardly wait for the day of departure,
which was finally set for November 8.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>The French were already driven out of Germany
at that time and the victorious allies had pursued
them into their own country. On January 1, 1814,
the King and his son reached Mannheim, on the
Rhine, and were soon across the borders and in
the midst of the seat of war. From Brienne and
Rosny sounded the thunder of cannon, and at
Bar-sur-Aube on February 27 Prince William was
permitted for the first time to take part in active
service.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>Early on the morning of that day the King sent
for his two sons (the Crown Prince had been with
the army from the beginning of the war) and said
to them: &ldquo;There will be a battle to-day. We have
taken the offensive and there may be hot work.
You shall watch it. Ride on and I will follow, but
do not expose yourselves to danger unnecessarily.
Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brothers dashed off to General Prince Wittgenstein,
where their father joined them, and they
were soon in the middle of the fight and in constant
danger of their lives. Suddenly the King
turned to Prince William. &ldquo;Ride back and find
out what regiment it is over yonder that is losing
so many men,&rdquo; he ordered. Like a flash William
was off, followed by admiring glances from the
soldiers as he galloped calmly through the hail of
bullets, obtained the desired information, and rode
slowly back. The King made no comment, but
General Wittgenstein, who had watched the Prince
with apprehension, gave him a kindly glance and
shook him warmly by the hand, William himself
seeming quite unconscious that he had been in such
danger and had just received his baptism of fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>On March 10, his mother&rsquo;s birthday, he received
from his father&rsquo;s hand the Iron Cross, and a few
days before this the royal allies of Prussia and Russia
had bestowed on him the fourth class of the Order
of Saint George for his bravery. These two decorations,
which can only be won under fire, made the
Prince realize for the first time the real meaning of
the incident at Bar-sur-Aube.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;why Herr von Jagow
and Herr von Luck pressed my hand and why the
others smiled so significantly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Emperor wore these two little crosses to the
end of his life, with special pride, as the first honors
he ever won, and would never have them replaced
by new ones. They were precious relics of his
baptism of fire at Bar-sur-Aube.</p>
<p>Swiftly the tide of war rolled on. Battle after
battle was won. Napoleon was dethroned and banished
to the island of Elba, and on March 31, 1814,
Prince William made his first victorious entry into
the enemy&rsquo;s proud capital. Here he took up his
quarters in the Hotel of the Legion of Honor
and on May 30 received the rank of Major in
the army. After visiting England and Switzerland
with his father in the course of the Summer, our
hero returned to Potsdam on the King&rsquo;s birthday
(August 3), where he was joyously welcomed by his
sisters. The following year Napoleon escaped from
Elba and regained possession of the throne of
France, only to exchange it after a sovereignty of
one hundred days for the lonely island of Saint
Helena in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>On June 8 of this year (1815) the confirmation
of Prince William took place, having been postponed
till that date on account of the war. In the
palace chapel at Charlottenburg he took the usual
vows and laid down for himself at the same time
those principles of life and conduct that are a splendid
witness to his nobility of mind, his seriousness
of purpose, his sincere piety and faith in the
Almighty, and his lofty conception of the duties
of his high calling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">Chapter III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Years of Peace</span></h2>
<p>After his confirmation Prince William
was hastening back to the seat of war
when the news of Napoleon&rsquo;s defeat and
banishment reached him. Nevertheless
he kept on and entered Paris again with the army.
During the three months that he remained there
this time he suffered from a sharp attack of pleurisy,
from which he quickly recovered, however. This
was the last evidence of his early delicacy, for henceforth
he enjoyed the most robust health and was
able to endure all the hardships of a soldier&rsquo;s life,
devoting himself to his chosen profession with the
greatest energy and enthusiasm and striving earnestly
to advance the military power and standing
of Prussia to a place among the great nations of
Europe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Even during his father&rsquo;s reign, as well as that of
his brother, he was considered the soul of the army
and looked upon by the troops as a pattern of all
the military virtues, while with his indefatigable
activity in all branches of the service he rose rapidly
to the highest commands. Frederick William Third
was not slow to recognize his son&rsquo;s abilities, for
when in 1818 he made a journey to Russia with
the Crown Prince, he intrusted the entire management
of military affairs to him during his absence.
The following year the Prince received a seat and
voice in the ministry of war, thus enabling him to
acquire as thorough a knowledge of army organization
and administration as he had already gained in
practical experience. Thereafter he took part in all
military conferences, while special details and commissions
of inspection familiarized him by personal
observation with army affairs in general.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>The close family ties between the royal houses of
Prussia and Russia, brought about by the marriage
of the Princess Charlotte, William&rsquo;s sister, to the
Grand Duke Nicholas, afterwards Czar, caused our
hero to be drawn into active intercourse with St.
Petersburg. At the time of the wedding, which
took place in Berlin, it fell to his share to accompany
his sister to her future home and represent the
Prussian throne at the festivities there. He was
received with great honors in St. Petersburg and
improved the occasion by attending the military
man&oelig;uvres which were held there and at Moscow.
His personal relations with the Russian court were
very intimate and were the cause of frequent visits
thither in the ensuing years.</p>
<p>The routine of his professional duties was often
varied by journeys and visits required by the service&mdash;such
as that to Italy in 1822, and a long one
made in 1826 with his younger brother Charles to
the court of Weimar, from which the two Princes
carried away the most delightful recollections, especially
of the Princesses Marie and Augusta, whose
acquaintance they had made on that occasion. Nor
was it to end in memories, for Prince Charles&rsquo;s betrothal
to the Princess Marie was soon announced,
and on May 26, 1827, the young couple were married.
As for William, several visits to the hospitable
grand-ducal court convinced him that no other
princess possessed to such a degree the qualities
necessary to his life&rsquo;s happiness as the modest and
amiable Princess Augusta, and they became betrothed
in February, 1829, the marriage following
on June 11 of that year.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>In May Prince William journeyed to St. Petersburg
to invite his sister and her husband to the
wedding, and on his return went directly to Weimar
to escort his fair bride to Berlin. On June 7
the Princess Augusta bade farewell to her beloved
home; two days later the bridal party reached Potsdam,
and on the tenth the state entry from Charlottenburg
took place. The Prussian capital had
not failed to prepare a royal welcome for Prince
William&rsquo;s bride, the fame of whose virtues had preceded
her, and all Berlin was agog to see and greet
the lovely Princess and the happy bridegroom. The
magnificent wedding lasted for three days, after
which the royal pair took possession of the so-called
Tauenziensche House which had been assigned to
the Prince as his official residence. Later it was
bought by him and rebuilt by the architect Langhaus
in substantially the form in which the present palace
at the entrance of the Linden has become familiar
to every German as the residence of the Emperor
William First.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>The home life of the Prince and Princess was
charmingly simple and domestic and their marriage
a singularly happy one, founded on mutual love
and respect. Both were distinguished for deep religious
feeling, a strong sense of duty and the responsibilities
of their position, as well as a deep-rooted
love of the Fatherland. On October 18, 1831, the
anniversary of the battle of Leipzic, the Princess
Augusta presented her husband with a son, afterward
the beloved Emperor Frederick, whose untimely
death was so deeply deplored; and on
December 3, 1838, she gave birth to a daughter,
Louise Marie Elizabeth, the present Grand Duchess
of Baden. These new joys brought also new duties
into the lives of the royal parents in the education
of their children, to which they devoted themselves
with the most loving care. While the father endeavoured
to develop in his son the qualities requisite
to make a good soldier, the clever mother saw
to it that his education should not be military only.
She was a constant patroness of art and learning
and was determined that her Fritz should have a
thorough knowledge of science and be a lover of
the fine arts, while her daughter Louise was early
taught to employ her time usefully and to become
accustomed to serious work under her mother&rsquo;s
guidance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>After 1835 the family began to spend the Summer
months at the Schloss Babelsberg on the Havel,
the site of which had been discovered by Prince
William at the time of some army man&oelig;uvres in
that neighborhood in 1821. After their marriage
the artistic young wife had drawn the plans for a
country residence there, which was afterward enlarged
considerably, and thus arose the Babelsberg
palace. The surroundings were soon converted by
expert hands into gardens and a magnificent park,
and it became the favorite residence of the Emperor
in his later years. He used to spend much time
there, and far from wishing to hide its beauties from
his subjects, he loved to have people come and
wander through the beautiful grounds. The minister
of war, Van Roon, indeed, tells how the old
Emperor once left his work to permit his study to
be shown to some visitors who had come a long
distance to gaze on the abode of their beloved
sovereign.</p>

<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Troublous Times</span></h2>
<p>On June 7, 1840, that sorely tried monarch
Frederick William Third, who had borne
so much with and for his people, breathed
his last, and the Crown Prince ascended
the throne as Frederick William Fourth, William
receiving the title of Prince of Prussia as had that
brother of Frederick the Great who afterward
succeeded him, thus being raised to the rank and
dignity of a Crown Prince, for the marriage of
Frederick William Fourth was childless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>On June 11 the body of the deceased King was
laid to rest in the mausoleum at Charlottenburg
beside that of his noble and much-lamented Queen.
And now began a period of ferment, difficult to
understand by those not directly concerned in it
or its after effects. Even at the time of the War
of Liberation a feeling of discontent had begun to
show itself among the people of Germany at the
condition of affairs created by the allies at the so-called
Congress of Vienna in 1814-1815. There
was an ever-increasing demand for popular representation
in the legislature, what is now called the
Diet or House of Deputies, and also a closer consolidation
of the national strength and resources,
such as would be afforded by a German Confederation
for the purpose of restoring the Empire to its
old power and importance. These ideas, as yet
but half-formed and visionary, were agitated, especially
by the youth of Germany, with a spirit and
enthusiasm that appeared so dangerous to the existing
order of things as to require suppression. At
the time of the French Revolution of 1830, they
began to assume more definite form, though under
the paternal rule of Frederick William Third no
general movement was attempted by his subjects.
With the accession of Frederick William Fourth,
however, the time seemed to have come to demand
the exchange of an absolute monarchy for a constitutional
form of government, and also, perhaps, the
re&euml;stablishment of the German Empire; but in both
respects their hopes were doomed to disappointment.
The King&rsquo;s refusal to grant the people a
voice in the government was as firm as his rejection
of the offer of an imperial throne. His action
aroused a deep feeling of dissatisfaction throughout
the country, which was increased by several years of
bad crops and famine, until at last the French Revolution
of 1848 lighted the torch of insurrection in
Germany also.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Frederick William Fourth had already assigned
to his brother, the Prince of Prussia, the responsible
post of guardian of the Rhine, and at the outbreak
of these disturbances he made him Governor
General of the Rhenish provinces and Westphalia.
Before the Prince had left Berlin, however, the uprising
had spread to that city also, so he remained
in close attendance upon the King, taking a leading
part in his councils as first Minister of State. Frederick
William Fourth was much disturbed by such
an unheard-of state of affairs in Prussia, and possibly
failed to appreciate the significance of the outbreak,
but rather than come to open conflict with
his people he had all the troops sent away from
Berlin. Bitter as the recollection must be, it remains
a lasting honor to the Prussian army that
this trying order was obeyed without a murmur or
complaint, and adds another laurel to those since
won on many a hard-fought field. The removal
of the troops gave the insurgents free scope for a
time, and the efforts of the leaders to direct the
anger of the deluded populace against the army, that
stanch and loyal bulwark of the throne, resulted in
setting the turbulent masses against the Prince of
Prussia likewise, who was well known as the army&rsquo;s
most zealous friend and patron. They even went
so far as to threaten to set fire to his palace, but a
few patriotic citizens succeeded in restraining them
at the critical moment. To avoid any further occasion
for such excesses, the King sent his brother
away to England, where he remained until the storm
had subsided, returning in May, 1848, to Babelsberg,
where he spent several months in retirement. The
King was finally forced to recall the troops, then
under the command of General von Wrangel, to quell
the tumult in Berlin, and shortly afterwards Prussia
was given its present constitution, by which the
people were granted a chamber of representatives.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>The insurrection of 1848, meanwhile, had spread
throughout the country and led to a revolution in
Baden, which overthrew the existing government and
assumed such serious proportions that the Grand
Duke besought the help of King Frederick William
Fourth, who at once despatched his brother,
the Prince of Prussia, to Baden with an army. It
was William&rsquo;s first experience as a commander.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>In June, 1849, he proceeded from Mainz to the
Palatinate of Bavaria, where he was welcomed with
open arms by the inhabitants. With the assistance
of his gallant young nephew Frederick Charles, he
soon quickly crushed the insurgents who were besieging
the Palatinate and pushed on across the
Rhine to Baden, where in a succession of engagements
he proved an inspiring example of coolness
and courage to his enthusiastic troops. After the
fight at Durlach, the townspeople brought out bread
and wine for the victorious Prussians. The Prince
was also offered a piece of bread, which he was about
to eat with relish when he saw a hungry soldier
watching him with longing glances. Quickly breaking
it in two he held out half to the man, saying
kindly, &ldquo;Here, comrade, take some too!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>It was by such acts as this that he won the devotion
of his soldiers. On June 25 he entered the
capital, Carlsruhe, and was hailed with joy by the
citizens, while the leader of the rebellion retired to
the castle of Rastall, where, after a few more unsuccessful
resistances, the greater part of the insurgents
also took refuge. The Prince immediately
laid siege to the place, and with such good results
that on July 23 it surrendered at discretion, and
the Prussians took possession the same day. On
August 18 the Grand Duke of Baden returned to
his capital, accompanied by the Prince of Prussia, to
whom he gave public thanks as the restorer of order
in the country, and soon after William set out on
his return to Berlin, where he was welcomed with
enthusiasm by his family, the populace, and above
all by the army.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>His duties as military governor of Westphalia
and the provinces of the Rhine required him to
take up his residence at Coblentz, where he remained
till 1857, with occasional journeys made in
the interest of the service or for the government.
These were unsettled and not very pleasant times,
for Austria was perpetually seeking to undermine
the power of Prussia and more than once the sword
was loosened in its sheath. But there were bright
spots also in the lives of the princely pair, such as
the marriage of their daughter Louise to the Grand
Duke of Baden. Another favorite wish was gratified
by the alliance of Prince Frederick with the Princess
Royal, Victoria of England, in 1857. Fresh troubles
occurred in this year also, for on the occasion
of some army man&oelig;uvres at Giebichenstein, King
Frederick William Fourth was stricken with apoplexy
and his brother was appointed to represent
him at the head of the government. At first it
was hoped that the trouble might be relieved, and
the arrangement was made for three months only;
but the apoplectic fits continued at intervals, and at
the end of a year, finding his condition worse rather
than improved, the King was forced to make the
Prince of Prussia Regent of the kingdom. Four
years later Frederick William Fourth was released
from his sufferings, and his brother ascended the
throne of Prussia as William First.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">Chapter V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">In Trust</span></h2>
<p>Our hero was nearly sixty-four years old
when he was called by Providence to
assume this exalted position, an age at
which men usually begin to look about
for a quiet spot wherein to end their days in peace
and freedom from care. But for King William,
though already on the threshold of age, this was out
of the question. This Nestor among German
princes had been chosen as an instrument for the
restoration of national unity and power. It was his
task, as head of the &ldquo;Holy German Empire,&rdquo; to
overthrow all her enemies and crown her arms with
victory and fame. And nobly did the venerable
monarch fulfil this trust, keeping a watchful eye on
the interests and welfare of the Fatherland for more
than twenty-seven years.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>The aims and hopes with which he began his
reign are set forth in the proclamation issued to
his people at that time. It hints too at the serious
struggle he saw approaching, in which Prussia
would have to fight for her existence against the
neighboring countries, jealous of her growing power.
It had been the labor of his life to provide the country
with a strong, well-disciplined army; his task
now as sovereign was to make it equal in size to any
demand that might be made upon it. During his
regency he had tried to secure the consent of the
Diet to a large increase in the standing army, and
preliminary measures had already been taken to this
effect, but after the Prince&rsquo;s accession to the throne
the House of Deputies withdrew its consent and
absolutely refused to grant the necessary appropriation.
This was a hard blow to the King, but he
felt that his duty to the country required him to
persist in his demands, a decision in which he was
loyally upheld by his recently appointed councillor,
Otto von Bismarck, a man of remarkable talents
and ability, to whom might well be applied the
poet&rsquo;s words:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;He was a man, take him for all in all,</p>
<p class="t0">I shall not look upon his like again.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>For a time, however, their efforts met with no
results, the Diet remaining firm in its refusal, and
finally disclaiming any participation in the policy of
the government, domestic or foreign. Not until
great events had occurred, not until splendid proofs
had been furnished of the wisdom of the King&rsquo;s
judgment, were the representatives convinced that
the aims of the government were for the country&rsquo;s
best good. Nor was it long before an opportunity
for such proofs was offered.</p>
<p>For many years the Kings of Denmark had
appropriated to themselves the title of Duke of
Schleswig-Holstein, though more as a matter of
form than of real sovereignty, for the two sea-girt
duchies had retained their own constitution, their
laws, and their language. Within the space of ten
years, however, it had become more and more apparent
that Denmark was aiming at complete absorption
and suppression of their nationality. In
1840, and again in 1850, they had struggled to
retain their independence, but in vain, being too
weak themselves and meeting with insufficient support
from their German brethren, who at that time
had all they could manage with their own affairs.
When, however, on November 15, 1863, King
Frederick Seventh of Denmark died and Christian
Ninth ascended the throne, Germany decided to
interfere in behalf of the duchies. As the various
States could come to no agreement, Prussia and
Austria, as the two leading powers, took matters
into their own hands. The Danish King was
called upon to evacuate Holstein within forty-eight
hours and to withdraw the form of government
introduced into Schleswig, and on his refusal to
comply with these demands Schleswig was at once
invaded. The general command of the expedition
was given to Von Wrangel, Prince Frederick
Charles leading the Prussian troops, Field Marshal
Lieutenant von Gablenz the Austrians who had
come on through Silesia and Brandenburg.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>On February 1, 1864, Wrangel gave the order
to advance &ldquo;in God&rsquo;s name!&rdquo;&mdash;an order which
proved the signal for a succession of heroic deeds
that covered the German army with glory, for
from the Danish War sprang that between Prussia
and Austria two years later, and in 1870 the
Franco-Prussian War. The first of February,
1864, therefore, surely deserves a place in the
pages of history as the starting point of the glorious
achievements of the German army and the
victorious career of its royal commander.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>King William himself took no active part in the
Danish War. Only about one and a half army
corps were mobilized, too small a force to be under
the command of the sovereign of so powerful a
nation as Prussia. But when after a number of
victorious engagements Prince Frederick Charles
succeeded in storming D&uuml;ppel and capturing all
the supposedly impregnable intrenchments, thus
proving that Prussia&rsquo;s old valor still survived in a
younger generation, King William could no longer
keep away from his victorious troops. His arrival
in Schleswig was hailed with joy by the people as
well as the army, and at Grevenstein he held a review
of the columns that had fought so brilliantly
at the storming of D&uuml;ppel, praising and thanking
them personally for their bravery. He also visited
the hospitals, encouraging the wounded with his
presence and kindly words of cheer. The people
of Schleswig were assured that their affairs would
be brought to a happy issue, and a feeling of confidence
in the speedy liberation of their brethren
from the power of Denmark spread throughout
Germany.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>And so it proved, for on June 28 the enemy&rsquo;s
defeat was completed by the capture of the island
of Alsen, used by the Danes as a storehouse for
arms and provisions. A truce was proclaimed, and
on October 30, 1864, the Peace of Vienna was concluded,
by which the King of Denmark renounced
all his rights to the duchies of Schleswig, Holstein,
and Lauenburg in favor of the King of Prussia and
the Emperor of Austria, and agreed to recognize
whatever disposition the allies should make of the
three States. This treaty, by completely freeing
the duchies from the power of Denmark, realized
one of the dearest wishes of the people, a wish that
had long been cherished in the hearts of patriots;
while to Germany it gave a greater increase of territory
and influence than had fallen to her share for
many years.</p>
<p>In spite of this fact, however, the idea of German
unity still seemed far from realization owing
to the conflicting interests of the several States,
of which there were more than thirty, each jealous
of the slightest supremacy of the others. When
Prussia proposed, therefore, that the three duchies
should be governed by their liberators rather than
be added to the German States, of which there were
already too many, the plan was bitterly opposed by
the majority of the Confederation. But Prussia was
determined not to yield, and with the co&ouml;peration
of Austria succeeded in carrying her point. By the
treaty of Gastein it was agreed that Austria should
assume the provisional administration of Holstein,
and Prussia that of Schleswig, while Lauenburg was
made over to the Prussian government for the sum
of seven and a half million marks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>It would seem that the army&rsquo;s splendid achievements
might have inclined the Diet to withdraw its
long-standing opposition to the plans and wishes of
the government, but such was not the case. Not
only did the majority of representatives refuse as
before to grant any appropriation for increasing the
army, but also failed to make provision for the cost
of the recent victorious campaign, expecting in this
way to force the government to yield. Nothing
was farther, however, from the intentions of King
William and his trusty councillor, Bismarck. Firmly
convinced that they were in the right, it would have
seemed treachery to the Fatherland to abandon their
purpose. Recognition of their efforts must come
some time, and as it proved, that day was not far
distant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Austro-Prussian War</span></h2>
<p>At Gastein, as has already been stated,
the Schleswig-Holstein affair had been
brought to a settlement, but it was only
a preliminary one. Fresh disputes soon
broke out between the two powers. Austria, already
regretting her compliance, inclined more and more
to the side of the enemies of Prussia, who wished
to restore the independence of Schleswig and Holstein
and make them part of the Confederation.
The old jealousy broke forth anew, and, unable
to reconcile herself to any real increase of Prussian
power, Austria attempted to force King William to
yield to the wishes of the Confederation. Laying
before the Diet the danger of permitting Prussia to
have its way, she succeeded in having a motion carried
to oppose that power. Convinced that war was
again inevitable, King William declared all former
negotiations off, and urged Saxony, Hanover, and
electoral Hesse to form an alliance preserving their
neutrality. But here, too, meeting with a repulse,
he was forced to put his whole army in the field
and enter the struggle alone. His real feelings on
the subject are evident from his parting words to
Prince Frederick Charles after war had been declared
and the march of troops into the enemy&rsquo;s
country had begun:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am an old man to be making war again, and
well know that I must answer for it to God and to
my conscience. Yet I can truthfully declare that I
have done all in my power to avert it. I have made
every concession to the Emperor that is consistent
with the honor of Prussia, but Austria is bent on
our humiliation and nothing short of war will satisfy
her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>Thus with a firm faith in God&rsquo;s help and the
righteousness of his cause the aged monarch placed
himself at the head of his army, resolved to perish
with it rather than yield in this vital question. Nor
did he trust in vain. By forced marches Generals
Vogel von Falkenstein and von Manteuffel invaded
northern Germany, took possession of Hanover, and
forced King George, after a gallant resistance at
Langensalza, to capitulate, abdicate his throne, and
abandon the country permanently. The main army,
divided into three parts, commanded respectively by
the Crown Prince, Prince Frederick Charles, and
General Herwarth von Bittenfeld, speedily overran
the enemy&rsquo;s country, and before the King had left
for the seat of war he was informed by telegraph
of the victories of Skalitz and M&uuml;nchengr&auml;tz, of
Nachod and Trautenau. The first decisive results
had been accomplished by the Crown Prince, and on
the morning of June 29 the King joyfully shouted
to the people from the open window of the palace:
&ldquo;My son has won a victory&mdash;good news from all
quarters! All is well&mdash;my brave army!&rdquo; The
next day he left Berlin, and on July 2 reached
Gitschin in Bohemia, where he was welcomed with
joy by Prince Frederick Charles and his victorious
troops. On the following day occurred one
of the most famous battles of history&mdash;that of
K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>The King had just lain down to rest the previous
night on the plain iron camp cot that accompanied
him everywhere, when Lieutenant General
von Voigts-Rhetz reached Gitschin with the news
that the Austrians were stationed between the Prussian
army and the Elbe. King William at once
summoned his great strategist, General von Moltke,
and Adjutant Count von Finkenstein was hastily
despatched to the Crown Prince with orders to
bring up his army, which was then in the mountains
of Silesia. The guns were already booming from the
neighboring heights and the smoke of battle beginning
to fill the valleys like a mist when the King
mounted his favorite mare Sadowa at the little village
of Kleinitz, early on the morning of July 3,
and dashed into the thick of the fray. The fire
was so sharp that his staff, large enough to have
been easily taken for a regiment of cavalry, was
forced to scatter, but finally reached a position on
the Roscoberg, where Count Finkenstein soon appeared
with word that the Crown Prince was already
on the march. Hour after hour passed, however,
and nothing was to be seen of him. The issue was
critical, and King William&rsquo;s anxiety grew more and
more intense, until at last, about two o&rsquo;clock in the
afternoon, the guns of the Crown Prince were heard
in the enemy&rsquo;s rear and the day was won. The
Austrians were soon in full flight and were pursued
as far as the Elbe by the victorious foe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Soon after the Crown Prince&rsquo;s arrival the King
left the Roscoberg and, followed by his staff, rode
down into the battle-field, urging the men to fresh
valor by his inspiring presence, and disregard of
danger from the enemy&rsquo;s fire. None of his escort
dared remonstrate with him, until at length the faithful
Bismarck summoned courage and, riding up beside
the King, begged him not to place his life in
such jeopardy. Kindly but earnestly he answered:
&ldquo;You have done right, my friend. But when
these brave fellows are under fire, the King&rsquo;s place
is with them. How can I retire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The results of this splendid victory were decisive,
but the chief glory rests with the Crown Prince,
whose troops after a long and exhausting march
arrived just in time to save the day. It was a
touching moment when the father and son met upon
the field of battle, and all eyes were wet as the King,
embracing Prince Frederick with fatherly pride,
pinned on his breast the Order of Merit. The
crushing defeat of K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz effectually broke the
enemy&rsquo;s resistance, and the Prussians had advanced
almost within sight of Vienna when the announcement
of a truce put an end to hostilities.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>In southern Germany the army of the Main under
General Vogel von Falkenstein had also ended the
struggle by a series of successful engagements, and
on August 23 a treaty of peace was signed at Prague,
by which Austria agreed to withdraw from the German
Confederation; and Schleswig-Holstein, Hanover,
electoral Hesse, Nassau, and the free city of
Frankfort-on-the-Main were permanently incorporated
with Prussia. Thus were King William&rsquo;s
labors at last crowned with success. Alone and
almost without a friend in Germany he had gone
forth to battle against a powerful enemy, and victory
had been his. Beyond the Alps, however, he had
found a friend in need in King Victor Emmanuel of
Italy, who had aided him by attacking Austria at the
same time from the south, thus dividing her forces.
Covered with laurels, the victorious troops returned,
meeting with ovations everywhere, but especially in
Berlin. The whole city was <i>en f&ecirc;te</i> to welcome
them. Triumphal arches were erected. Countless
wreaths, banners, and garlands of flowers decorated
the streets. Strains of music, pealing of bells, thunder
of cannon proclaimed the arrival of the army, as it
entered the city gates, headed by the heroic monarch
and greeted with tumultuous shouts by the populace.
An altar had been erected in the Lustgarten, where a
praise service was held, the troops and people joining
in singing &ldquo;Ein&rsquo; feste Burg ist unser Gott.&rdquo; The
eleventh of November was appointed as a day of
general thanksgiving throughout the country, and
trees were planted everywhere in commemoration of
the joyful occasion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>The results of this war did even more than those
of the preceding one with Denmark to prove the
wisdom of the King&rsquo;s position in regard to the army,
besides the large increase of territory it brought to
Prussia. By far the most important issue of the
campaign, however, was the establishment of the
North German Confederation and the conclusion of
an offensive and defensive alliance between this and
the South German States, by which both agreed to
respect the inviolability of each other&rsquo;s territory and
bound themselves in time of war to place their whole
military force at the other&rsquo;s disposal, the chief command
of the united armies to be intrusted in such
case to King William of Prussia. Thus did our
august hero advance slowly but surely toward the
realization of his hopes and aims, and visions of a
restoration of the glories of the ancient holy German
Empire already thrilled the hearts of patriots with a
promise of the final fulfilment of their long-cherished
dreams, as the King in his magnificent speech before
the Imperial Diet on February 24, 1867, painted in
glowing terms the future of a united Fatherland.
Even the Prussian House of Deputies were weary of
the long contention, and in the face of the universal
recognition and admiration awarded their sovereign&rsquo;s
achievements, it abandoned its opposition to the government,
and the King&rsquo;s courage and perseverance
were at last rewarded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Franco-Prussian War</span></h2>
<p>The period immediately following the
Austro-Prussian War was a comparatively
peaceful one, but the gradual increase of
national strength and power in Germany
had long since aroused the jealousy of France, and
there was little hope of bringing about the unification
of the country until the opposition of this
hereditary enemy had been ended by a final and decisive
struggle. And for this France herself soon
furnished a pretext, though without any just cause.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>The throne which Napoleon Third had seized by
force was weak and crumbling, and it was only with
the greatest difficulty that he was able to keep up
an appearance of the magnificence for which his
court had been famous. Nor was it founded on
patriotism and love of liberty, those firm supports
of sovereignty; on the contrary, the present occupant
of the throne of France had aroused much
dislike and condemnation among his subjects, and
not without cause. Public dissatisfaction throughout
the country increased daily, and the Emperor,
alarmed for the future, determined at length that
the only resource left him was to occupy the attention
of the people by a great war, and give them
something else to think of. Should it prove successful,
his sinking star would doubtless rise once
more to dazzling heights, while if defeated, no worse
fate could overtake him than that which now threatened.
As to whom the war should involve in
order to make the strongest appeal to the sentiments
and prejudices of the French, there could
be no doubt, for from the earliest times there has
been no nation so hated by them as Germany.
Ever since the battle of K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz King William
and his ministers had felt sure that France would
not view Prussia&rsquo;s increase of power without a
protest, though they had been careful to avoid
giving her any pretext for making trouble. But
there is an English saying, &ldquo;Where there is a
will there is a way,&rdquo; the truth of which was proved
by the French.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>After the revolution which had deposed Queen
Isabella the Spaniards were looking about for a
King, and of the many candidates who offered
themselves their choice fell on Prince Leopold of
Hohenzollern. This was cause enough for grievance
on the part of France, and King William, as
head of the house of Hohenzollern, was requested
through the French ambassador Benedetti to forbid
his kinsman&rsquo;s acceptance of the Spanish crown.
To this our hero replied by refusing to put any
constraint on the Prince&rsquo;s decision; but Leopold,
finding that his acquiescence in the wishes of Spain
was likely to cause serious complications between
France and Prussia, voluntarily withdrew his candidacy,
thus, it would seem, removing any cause for
trouble between the two powers. France, however,
whose chief desire was to humiliate Prussia, had
no intention of allowing this opportunity to slip
through her fingers. Benedetti was ordered to obtain
from King William, who was then staying at
Ems, a written declaration that he regretted the
annoyance this matter had caused Napoleon and
would never again permit Prince Leopold to be a
candidate for the throne of Spain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>The King&rsquo;s behavior on receipt of this insulting
demand was worthy of so great a sovereign. Calmly
turning his back on the obtrusive Benedetti, he
refused to have anything more to say to him and
referred him to the ministry in Berlin for further discussion
of the subject. This was on the thirteenth
of July, 1870, and a stone now marks the spot on
the promenade at Ems where this brief conference
took place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>War was declared on the following day in Paris,
and King William responded by issuing an order
for the immediate mobilization of the entire army.
The news was hailed with joy throughout the country.
Napoleon had already brought about the very
thing he most wished to prevent&mdash;the unification
of all the German-speaking peoples. The
whole nation rose in indignation at the insult that
had been offered to the aged King, and his return to
Berlin was like a triumphal progress. Everywhere
crowds assembled to greet him, eager to express
their admiration of the dignified way in which he
had met the insolence and presumption of France.
His appearance in the capital was hailed with
wildest enthusiasm by his loyal subjects, and, deeply
moved by their devotion, the King turned to his
companions, saying: &ldquo;This is as it was in 1813!&rdquo;
What most gratified him, however, was the despatch
that promptly arrived from South Germany, which,
but a short time since in arms against Prussia,
now that a common enemy threatened the Fatherland,
hastened to enroll her whole forces under
the banner of the commander-in-chief. Little did
France know the people or the spirit of Germany
when she counted on the support of the South
German States, expecting them to hail her with
joy as their deliverer from the yoke of Prussia!
Events now crowded fast on one another, yet there
was little commotion in the country. Thanks to
King William&rsquo;s splendid organization, even this
sudden mobilization of the whole army proceeded
quietly and steadily, as if it were no more than the
execution of some long-prepared-for man&oelig;uvre,&mdash;a
state of things that served to calm and encourage
both army and people. The German forces were
divided into three great armies: the first, commanded
by General von Steinmetz, stationed along
the Moselle; the second, under Prince Frederick
Charles, at the Rhine Palatinate; while the third,
consisting chiefly of the South German troops
under the Crown Prince, occupied the upper Rhine
country.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>The King left Berlin July 31 to take command
of the united forces. At half-past five in the
afternoon the iron gates of the side entrance to
the palace were flung open and the King and Queen
drove out in an open carriage drawn by two horses.
A roar of welcome greeted the vigorous old hero,
who in military cloak and cap sat bowing acknowledgment
to the rousing cheers of his enthusiastic
subjects, while the Queen at his side seemed deeply
affected. The royal carriage could scarcely make
its way through the weeping and rejoicing throngs
that swarmed about it all the way to the railway
station, eager to bid farewell to their beloved sovereign
and wish him a happy return. Banners
floated from the roofs of houses and handkerchiefs
fluttered from open windows,&mdash;a scene which was
only typical of the feeling that pervaded the whole
land. At the station the King&rsquo;s companions were
already awaiting him, his brother Prince Charles,
General of Ordnance, and that great trio who had so
ably assisted him in the previous war, Bismarck,
von Moltke, and Minister of War van Roon, surrounded
by a group of other generals. After
the Queen had departed, King William entered the
waiting train and moved off westward toward the
seat of war, followed by the unanimous shout &ldquo;With
God!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>And truly God was &ldquo;with King and Fatherland,&rdquo;
for in seemingly endless succession the telegraph
brought news to the astonished people of one great
victory after another. The French were wildly
enthusiastic when with two entire army corps they
finally forced a single Prussian battalion of infantry
and three squadrons of uhlans to retreat after the
latter had held out for fourteen days, and then with
more than twenty guns bombarded the unprotected
town of Saarbr&uuml;cken; but it was to be their only
occasion for rejoicing.</p>
<p>On the fourth of August Queen Augusta received
the following message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A splendid but bloody victory won by Fritz at the
storming of Weissenberg. God be praised for this first
glorious achievement.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The news quickly spread throughout the country,
bringing joy and renewed confidence to all hearts.
Two days later word came of a second victory for
the Crown Prince. He had completely defeated
the great Marshal MacMahon at W&ouml;rth, August 6,
and King William in his despatch to his wife might
with just pride send word to Berlin that &ldquo;it should
be in love with Victoria!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>A series of engagements followed, in the neighborhood
of Metz, on the fourteenth, sixteenth, and
eighteenth of August, which changed the general
plans of the German army. The French Marshal
Bazaine had attempted to invade the enemy&rsquo;s territory
from that place, but without success, while MacMahon,
who had advanced from Ch&acirc;lons to the
borders of the Palatinate and Baden, had suffered
such losses at Weissenberg and W&ouml;rth that he was
forced to fall back to his former position. It was
therefore decided that the two French armies should
unite in the neighborhood of Ch&acirc;lons and, thus
strengthened, offer battle to the enemy. To prevent
this, the Germans at once attacked Bazaine,
cutting off his retreat to Ch&acirc;lons and occupying him
until the arrival of some of their delayed corps.
The man&oelig;uvre was successful, and after two days
of hard fighting at Courcelles on the fourteenth, and
Mars la Tour on the sixteenth, the struggle culminated
two days later in the great battle of Gravelotte.
It was for life or death; the desperate struggle of
a brave army&mdash;the best, perhaps, that France ever
sent into the field. But all in vain. Closer and
closer about them drew the iron ring. German
courage and tenacity permitted no escape.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>At nine o&rsquo;clock that evening King William sent
his wife this despatch from the camp at Rezonville:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The French army attacked to-day in strong position
west of Metz. Completely defeated in nine hours&rsquo; battle,
cut off from communication with Paris, and driven back
towards Metz.</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">William.</span>&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the letter that followed he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It was half-past eight in the evening before the firing
ceased.... Our troops accomplished wonders of bravery
against an equally gallant enemy who disputed every step.
I have not dared to ask what our losses are. I would have
camped here, but after several hours found a room where I
could rest. We brought no baggage from Pont-&agrave;-Mousson,
so I have not had my clothes off for thirty hours. Thank
God for our victory!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Sedan</span></h2>
<p>Bazaine was now shut up in Metz and
closely surrounded by the first, seventh,
eighth, ninth, and tenth corps, under the
command of Prince Frederick Charles;
MacMahon&rsquo;s diminished army had retreated to
Ch&acirc;lons, where it was met by the Garde Mobile.
Except for this the road to Paris was open. It was
therefore determined by the Germans to mass all
their available forces and advance upon the capital
without delay. It was fully expected at headquarters
that MacMahon would dispute their way and
that another battle must first be fought in the
neighborhood of Ch&acirc;lons. Great was the surprise,
therefore, when news was brought by scouts that
the enemy had abandoned this important post and
retired northward. This was inexplicable. Why
not have gone to the westward in the direction
of Paris? The commander-in-chief was not easily
deceived, however, and as for Moltke, one must indeed
rise betimes to get the better of him in strategy.
MacMahon&rsquo;s purpose soon became apparent. By
a wide circuit from Ch&acirc;lons northeast to the Belgian
frontier, and then southward again, he hoped
to annihilate the besieging forces at Metz, release
Bazaine, and thus reinforced to attack the rear
of the army that was advancing on Paris,&mdash;a fine
plan, but not fine enough to succeed against King
William and his generals. A flank movement by
the combined German forces to the right was ordered
and a series of forced marches made to intercept
MacMahon before he could reach Metz. It
was a bold and exciting chase, led by the Crown
Prince, Frederick William.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>The French struggled desperately to gain their
end, but all in vain; on the first of September they
found themselves completely surrounded at Sedan,
a fortress on the Belgian frontier, and forced to a
decisive battle. King William himself was in command,
and what a battle it was! Prussians, Bavarians,
W&uuml;rtembergers, Saxons vied with one another
in deeds of daring and contempt of death against
an enemy who, with the courage of despair, accomplished
marvels of valor; yet when the day was ended
MacMahon&rsquo;s army had surrendered, and with it the
author of all the trouble,&mdash;Napoleon himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>Great were the rejoicings over this victory! King
William and his gallant son were hailed on all sides
with the wildest enthusiasm, their praises sounded
far and wide. The Crown Prince and his cousin
Prince Frederick Charles were rewarded for their
services to the Fatherland by being made field
marshals immediately after the fall of Metz, an
event that had never before occurred in the history
of the house of Hohenzollern.</p>
<p>The first telegram sent by the King to the Queen
after this latest victory ran as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Before Sedan, September 2, 2.30 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>: The capitulation
of the entire army in Sedan has just been arranged
with General Wimpffen commanding in place of MacMahon,
who was wounded. The Emperor only surrendered
himself to me personally, since he is not in command,
and has left everything to the Regency in Paris. I
will decide on his place of residence after the interview
which I am to have with him at once. What a fortunate
turn of affairs has been vouchsafed by Providence!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the third of September this despatch was
followed by a letter, from which we quote:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Vendresse</span>, September 3, 1870.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;By this time you have learned from my telegram the
extent of the great historical event that has just happened.
It is like a dream, even though one has seen it unroll itself
hour by hour.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then follows a brief and concise description of
the battle and its results:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;On the night of the thirty-first the army took up its
prearranged positions about Sedan, and early in the morning
firing began in spite of a dense fog. When I arrived at
the front about eight o&rsquo;clock, the large batteries had already
opened fire on the fortifications, and a hot fight soon developed
at all points, lasting almost the entire day, during
which our side gained ground. A number of deep wooded
defiles hindered the advance of the infantry and favored the
defence, but village after village was captured and a circle
of fire gradually closed in about Sedan. It was a magnificent
sight from our position on a height behind one of the
batteries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last the enemy&rsquo;s resistance began to weaken, as we
could perceive from the broken battalions that were driven
back from the woods and villages. Gradually their retreat
was turned into a flight in many places, infantry, cavalry,
and artillery all crowding together into the town and its
environments; but as they gave no intimation of relieving
their desperate situation by surrendering, there was nothing
left for us but to bombard the town. After twenty minutes
it was burning in several places, and with the flaming villages
all about the field of battle the spectacle was a terrible
one. I therefore had the firing slackened and sent Lieutenant
von Bronsart of the general staff with a flag of
truce to demand the surrender of the army and citadel.
On inquiring for the commander-in-chief, he was unexpectedly
taken before the Emperor, who had a letter he
wished delivered to me. The Emperor asked his errand,
and on learning it replied that he should have to refer him
to General von Wimpffen, who had assumed command
after MacMahon was wounded, and that he would send
his Adjutant General Reille with the letter to me. It was
seven o&rsquo;clock when the two officers arrived; Bronsart
was a little in advance, and from him we first learned
with certainty that the Emperor was in Sedan. You can
imagine the sensation this news caused! Reille then
sprang from his horse and delivered to me his Emperor&rsquo;s
letter, adding that he had no other commission. It began
as follows: &lsquo;Not having been able to die at the head of
my troops, it only remains for me to place my sword in
the hands of Your Majesty.&rsquo; All other details were left
to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My answer was that I regretted the manner of our
meeting and requested him to appoint a commission to arrange
for a capitulation. After I had handed my letter to
General Reille, I spoke a few words with him as an old
acquaintance, and he took his departure. On my side I
named Moltke with Bismarck to fall back upon in case any
political questions should arise, then rode to my carriage
and came here, greeted everywhere with thundering shouts
by the marching troops that filled the streets, cheering and
singing folk-songs. It was most thrilling! Many carried
lighted candles, so that at times it was like being escorted
by an improvised torchlight procession. I arrived here
about eleven o&rsquo;clock and drank with my staff to the army
which had achieved such glorious results. The next morning,
as I had heard nothing from Moltke of the negotiations
which were to take place at Donchery, I drove as agreed
to the battle-field about eight o&rsquo;clock and met Moltke, who
was coming to obtain my consent to the proposed surrender.
He told me that the Emperor had left Sedan as early as
five o&rsquo;clock and had come to Donchery. As he wished to
speak to me and there was a small <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> in the neighborhood,
I chose this for our meeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At ten o&rsquo;clock I arrived on the heights before Sedan;
at twelve Moltke and Bismarck appeared with the signed
articles of capitulation, and at one I started, without Fritz,
escorted by the cavalry staff. I alighted before the <i>ch&acirc;teau</i>,
where the Emperor met me. The interview lasted a quarter
of an hour; we were both much moved at meeting
again under such circumstances. What my feelings were,
after having seen Napoleon only three years before at the
summit of his power, I cannot describe. [King William
had been in Paris in 1867 on the occasion of the World&rsquo;s
Exposition there.]</p>
<p>&ldquo;After this interview I reviewed all the troops before
Sedan; their welcome to me, the sight of their ranks so
terribly thinned&mdash;all of this I cannot write of to-day. I
was deeply touched by so many proofs of loyalty and devotion,
and it is with a full heart that I close this long letter.
Farewell.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hurrah! du grosse Zeit!</i>&rdquo; It was indeed a
glorious but also a solemn and heart-stirring time.
Men, women, and children of all classes stood
breathlessly about the public bulletin-boards, and
when the news of Sedan was received, an irrepressible
storm of enthusiasm swept over the country,
even to the remotest solitudes. Men whose hearts
had long been hardened by the cares and troubles
of life burst into tears of joy; the hands of enemies
were clasped in reconciliation, and mothers
rejoiced that their sons had been so fortunate as
to take part in this great event. Napoleon a captive
at Wilhelmsh&ouml;he in Cassel, MacMahon&rsquo;s army
prisoners of war in Germany, Marshal Bazaine
shut up in Metz, and France, imperial France,
prostrated at the feet of the foe she had so wantonly
injured! But King William had said to
Count Bismarck after the capture of Sedan, &ldquo;Great
and glorious as is this victory, it will not bring us
peace as yet&rdquo;; and he was right. It is true that
with Napoleon&rsquo;s surrender and the subsequent
flight from Paris of the Empress Eug&eacute;nie, who
had been appointed regent, the Empire fell, but
hard on its heels followed the Republic, the &ldquo;Government
for the National Defence,&rdquo; headed by
General Trochu as Governor of Paris, the most
important members of which were Jules Favre
and Gambetta. In what spirit these men undertook
to conduct the government is evident from
a circular letter to the French ambassadors in foreign
courts which was full of lies and calumnies
of over-weaning pride and self-deception. Had
they really wanted peace, they might have easily
availed themselves of the opportunity offered by
the ensuing negotiations for a truce. But unwilling
to own herself defeated, France would only
agree to peace on terms which were impossible for
King William, as guardian of Germany&rsquo;s honor, to
accept. This high-sounding letter, therefore, had
no more influence with Germany than with the
other powers, and the war pursued its bloody
course.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>All the available forces of Germany now advanced
on Paris, and soon the great city was completely
invested. Attempt after attempt was made
by the new Republic to place new armies in the field.
The imprisoned forces in Paris, Metz, and Strassburg
harassed and struggled against the encircling
enemy, but all in vain. Battle after battle was
won by the invincible Germans. Orleans, Coulmiers,
Armiens, Le Mans, St. Quentin, La Bourget,
Belfort, and many others testified to their
valor. Fortress after fortress capitulated,&mdash;Strassburg,
Toul, Metz, and finally Paris, after a terrific
bombardment. In the midst of all these conquests,
however, a great and solemn act was quietly consummated,&mdash;the
fulfilment of the dream of thousands
of patriots, the restoration of the glories of the
old Empire in the final unification of Germany. In
the palace of Louis Fourteenth, that Prince whose
whole aim and endeavor had been to bring about
the destruction and humiliation of Germany, King
William First of Prussia was proclaimed German
Emperor January 18, 1871, the same day on
which, one hundred and seventy years before, his
ancestor, the Elector Frederick Third of Brandenburg,
had been crowned King of Prussia. The
grand salon of Versailles was chosen as the scene
of the ceremony, and amid all the splendor that
had surrounded the Kings of France a modest
altar was erected, covered with red velvet and
adorned with two lighted golden candelabra. Before
it stood a Prussian divine in his plain black
robes, and on either side troops were stationed, consisting
of men chosen from each of the regiments
encamped about Paris. The banners of these regiments,
each supported by a non-commissioned
officer, were placed on a dais at the end of the hall,
in which about six hundred officers were assembled,
their gay and varied uniforms making a brilliant
scene.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>Just at noon the King entered with the Crown
Prince, followed by a train of royal and noble guests,
and took his place before the altar, Bismarck and
von Moltke standing near by. The service opened
with the chorale, &ldquo;Praise the Lord, all the World,&rdquo;
sung by a chorus of soldiers with trombone accompaniment;
then the liturgy, followed by another
hymn, and a sermon by Rogge, the court chaplain
from Potsdam, from the twenty-first Psalm, concluding
with an exultant &ldquo;Now all thank God.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>The King then rose and, followed by all the
princes and Count Bismarck, walked over to the
dais where the standard-bearers stood, and halted at
the edge of the platform, the Crown Prince on his
right, to the left the Chancellor of the Confederacy,
the princes ranging themselves behind the King.
In a voice shaken by emotion the aged monarch
declared his acceptance of the imperial throne that
had been offered him by the unanimous voice of
the princes of Germany and the free imperial cities
and representatives of the North German Confederation.
Count Bismarck then read aloud a proclamation
prepared by the King for this occasion, which
ran as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">To the People of Germany</span>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We, William, by God&rsquo;s grace King of Prussia, hereby
announce that the German princes and Free Towns having
addressed to us a unanimous call to renew and undertake,
with the re&euml;stablishment of the German Empire, the dignity
of Emperor, which now for sixty years has been in
abeyance, and the requisite provisions having been inserted
in the constitution of the German Confederation, we regard
it as a duty we owe to the entire Fatherland to comply with
this call and to accept the dignity of Emperor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accordingly, we and our successors to the crown of
Prussia henceforth shall use the imperial title in all our
relations and affairs of the German Empire; and we hope
under God it may be vouchsafed to the German nation to
lead the Fatherland on to a blessed future under the auspices
of its ancient splendor. We undertake the imperial dignity,
conscious of the duty to protect, with German loyalty, the
rights of the Empire and its members, to preserve peace, to
maintain the independence of Germany, and to strengthen
the power of the people. We accept it in the hope that it
will be granted to the German people to enjoy in lasting
peace the reward of its arduous and heroic struggles within
boundaries which will give to the Fatherland that security
against renewed French attacks which it has lacked for
centuries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May God grant to us and our successors to the imperial
crown, that we may be the defenders of the German
Empire at all times, not in martial conquests, but in works
of peace in the sphere of natural prosperity, freedom, and
civilization.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Given at Headquarters, Versailles, the eighteenth of
January, 1871.</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">William.</span>&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>After the reading of this proclamation the Grand
Duke of Baden stepped forward and cried in a loud
voice, &ldquo;Long live King William, the German Emperor!&rdquo;
and an exultant shout burst from the great
assembly. Tears rolled down the cheeks of the
aged sovereign and his stately form was visibly
shaken with emotion. The Crown Prince was the
first to do homage to the newly made Emperor by
kissing his hand, but the father clasped his son
in his arms and kissed him repeatedly. He also
embraced his brother Charles and his cousin, Admiral
Adalbert, his brother-in-law, the Grand Duke
of Weimar, and his son-in-law the Grand Duke of
Baden, after which he was saluted in turn by the
other princes and the rest of the assemblage, for
each of whom he had a kindly word. As the Emperor
departed from the royal palace of the Bourbons
the banner of the Hohenzollerns was lowered
and the German Imperial ensign floated out upon
the breeze. Thus was this great act consummated
amid the thunder of guns that shook the
capital of France and woke so mighty an echo in
the heart of the Fatherland.</p>
<p>The war was continued for a time, but after the
destruction of the armies of the Loire and of the
north the guns about Paris were silent, and on
January 29, 1871, the Emperor sent the following
telegram to his wife from Versailles:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Last night a three weeks&rsquo; truce was signed. All troops
in Paris are prisoners of war. The Provisional Government
guarantees to maintain order. We occupy all forts.
Paris remains in a state of siege and must provide for itself.
All arms to be surrendered. A Constituent Assembly will
be elected to meet at Bordeaux in fourteen days. This is
the reward of our people for their patriotism, their sacrifices
and heroic courage. I thank God for all His mercies.
May peace soon follow!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Emperor&rsquo;s prayer was soon to be granted,
for on the twenty-fifth of February the Empress
received the following message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;With a glad and thankful heart I am able to inform
you that the preliminaries of peace have just been arranged.
Now there is only the consent of the National Assembly
at Bordeaux to be obtained.</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">William.</span>&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a letter dated March 2, 1871, he writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I have just ratified the treaty of peace. Thus far the
great work is finished which seven months of victorious
warfare has made possible, thanks to the bravery and
endurance of the army in all its branches and the willing
sacrifices of the Fatherland. The Lord of Hosts has
blessed our undertaking and led to this honorable peace.
To Him be the glory! To the army and the Fatherland
my deepest and most heart-felt thanks!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>It was indeed an honorable peace, won by a series
of victories unparalleled in the world&rsquo;s history.
Alsace and Lorraine, formerly torn by France from
Germany when enfeebled by internal warfare, were
restored to her, Strassburg once more mirrored her
cathedral spires in the waters of a German Rhine,
and five milliards of francs were also to be paid by
France as indemnity for the expenses of the war.</p>
<p>On the sixteenth of June the victorious troops
made their entry into Berlin amid celebrations even
more imposing than those of 1866. The whole length
of the Sieges strasse, through which the troops passed,
a distance of almost a mile, was bordered with cannon
captured from the French, while non-commissioned
officers from each regiment, decorated with the Iron
Cross, carried eighty-one French eagles and standards.
A continuous ovation greeted the Emperor,
his generals, and the troops all along the line of
march. The celebration of the victory found a fitting
climax in the unveiling of the monument to
Frederick William Third in the Lustgarten, at
the foot of which his son could lay the trophies of
a glorious and successful war, and as the head of a
newly restored and powerful German Empire consecrate
the fulfilment of his trust.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Army Anecdotes</span></h2>
<p>Innumerable anecdotes are told of the
personal relations between the Emperor William
and his soldiers, a few of which may be given
as helping to throw light on the portrait of this
great yet kindly sovereign.</p>
<p>After the battle of Mars-la-Tour, the country all
about was strewn with dead and wounded soldiers.
It was only with the greatest difficulty that a small
room was found for the King&rsquo;s use, containing a
bed, a table, and a chair. As he entered it he
asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are Bismarck and Moltke lodged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nowhere as yet,&rdquo; replied the adjutant, well
knowing how needful rest was to them also.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then ask them to come and camp here with
me,&rdquo; said the King. &ldquo;You may take away the
bed&mdash;it will be needed by the wounded&mdash;and
have some straw and blankets brought here; they
will do very well for us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>And so it chanced that the three old comrades
spent a rainy night together on the straw; nor was
it the only time during this hard and cruel war.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>The day after the victory of Gravelotte, as King
William was returning to Pont-&agrave;-Mousson, he
passed through the village of Gorze. The Commander-in-chief
was greeted everywhere with the
wildest enthusiasm, even by the wounded, with
whom the little town was filled. Among the latter
was Captain von Zedtwitz. He was lodged with
an old soldier Antoine, who had lost a leg at Magenta
and who with his little daughter nursed and
cared for the desperately wounded officer as well as
he was able. When the captain heard the shouts
outside, and learned that King William was passing
through Gorze, he insisted on sending a greeting
to his sovereign likewise. He asked one of the
musicians to deliver to the Commander-in-chief a
pure white rose with the message: &ldquo;A wounded
officer who can scarcely live through another day,
sends this rose to Your Majesty, in memory of
Gravelotte!&rdquo; The King bade his coachman stop.
Deeply moved, he took the rose and fastened it in
his buttonhole. Then, after asking the name of
the thoughtful donor and sending his hearty thanks
with wishes for a speedy recovery, went on his way.
After a long and tedious illness the captain finally
recovered, but was no longer fit for active service.
In recognition of his services to the Fatherland
he was given the position of district commander in
Halberstadt. He had long since forgotten the
rose of Gorze, but the Emperor had a good
memory where his faithful soldiers were concerned,
as Captain von Zedtwitz was to discover. On
Christmas Day, 1871, he received a box containing
a magnificent oil painting depicting a monument on
which were inscribed the words &ldquo;Gorze, August 19,
1870.&rdquo; A German flag half covered the monument,
at the foot of which was an infantry helmet
decorated with an Iron Cross and encircled by a
laurel leaf. At the top of the heavy gold frame
gleamed a massive silver rose. Accompanying this
gift was the following note in the Emperor&rsquo;s own
handwriting:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In grateful remembrance of that never-to-be-forgotten
day in Gorze when you, desperately wounded, sent me a
rose from your couch of pain as I, unknowing, was passing
by. May the accompanying picture serve as a lasting
token of your devotion to your sovereign and his gratitude
to you. Christmas, 1871.</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">William I. R.</span></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;December 22, 1871.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the battle of Sedan the King&rsquo;s headquarters
were at Clermont, with a regiment of Bavarian
cavalry in guard. The men had had a long, hard
march in the rain that day, and their commanding
officer, feeling ill, despatched his orderly in search of
some wine. It was forbidden to ask for supplies at
headquarters, so the colonel gave him a thaler and
charged him to buy it somewhere. On reaching
the marketplace the trooper discovered a large
tavern, before the door of which stood two Prussian
staff orderlies who, as he approached, motioned him
to pass on. With the thaler in his hand, however,
the Bavarian felt himself as good as any one, so he
marched boldly up to the door of the inn and
knocked loudly. For some time there was no response,
but at length it was opened by an elderly
officer, who asked him what he wanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My colonel is sick and must have a flask of
wine,&rdquo; replied the orderly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;In just a moment, my son!&rdquo; said the old man
with a kindly smile, and disappeared within the
house, but soon returned with a flask which he
handed to the other, saying, &ldquo;Here is what your
colonel needs. I hope it will do him good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bavarian took the wine in his left hand, still
grasping the thaler in his right. What should
he do? He was not allowed to accept anything
without paying for it, neither could he offer money
to an officer. At length the old man, perceiving
his embarrassment, inquired whether his colonel
had given him any other commission. Whereupon
the honest fellow explained his difficulty, at the
same time attempting to thrust the thaler into the
old man&rsquo;s hand. But the latter only waved him
away, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind that, my good man, but hurry
back to your colonel with the wine, and say the
King of Prussia sends it to him with wishes for a
speedy recovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King of Prussia!&rdquo; repeated the Bavarian
in bewilderment. &ldquo;Where is the King of Prussia,
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am he,&rdquo; replied the old man, and shut the
door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>The colonel was anxiously waiting his orderly&rsquo;s
return, but looked very grave when he laid the
thaler on the table beside the flask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fool!&rdquo; he cried angrily, &ldquo;did I not tell
you not to make any requisition?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I did not, sir,&rdquo; replied the fellow with a
grin. &ldquo;There was an old man at the tavern who
said he was the King of Prussia; he gave me the
flask and wished you a quick recovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that!&rdquo; cried the colonel in great
excitement. &ldquo;From the King of Prussia, did you
say?&rdquo; and he gazed with astonishment at the good
monarch&rsquo;s gift. With awe he lifted the first glass to
his thirsty lips, thinking to himself, &ldquo;This is from
the King of Prussia,&rdquo; but as the last drop disappeared
he shouted aloud in a burst of enthusiasm,
&ldquo;Long live King William!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>One day during the siege of Paris, as the King
was visiting the outposts, he discovered a fusileer
deeply absorbed in a letter, his weapon on the
ground at his feet and apparently quite oblivious
to his duties. Roused by the sound of hoofs and
recognizing his commander-in-chief, he hastily
dropped the letter, took up his gun, and presented
arms. The King rode up to him and said,
smiling:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;A letter from the sweetheart at home, no
doubt, my son!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sire,&rdquo; replied the terrified soldier; &ldquo;it is
from my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somewhat doubtful of the truth of these words,
the King looked sternly at him and asked to see it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, Your Majesty,&rdquo; replied the soldier,
and quickly picking up the letter he handed it to
his chief. The King read it through, glanced
kindly at the fusileer, and told his adjutant to take
the man&rsquo;s name, then rode on. The letter <i>was</i>
from the man&rsquo;s mother, telling of his sister&rsquo;s approaching
marriage and the sorrow of all there that
he could not be present.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>The next day the fusileer was ordered to appear
before his captain, and he obeyed the summons with
an anxious heart, thinking to himself, &ldquo;Now I am
undone! This means at least eight days&rsquo; arrest for
neglect of duty.&rdquo; Great was his surprise, therefore,
when the captain informed him that by the King&rsquo;s
orders he had been granted fourteen days&rsquo; leave to
attend his sister&rsquo;s wedding, and that free transportation
there and back would be furnished him. The
overjoyed soldier was soon on the train bound for
his distant home, where a joyous welcome waited
his unexpected arrival. When the wedding guests
heard the story of the letter, they all clinked glasses
joyfully and drank to the King&rsquo;s health with a
rousing cheer.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>A grenadier of the First Regiment of Guards was
also one of the gardeners at Babelsberg. The Emperor
arriving there unexpectedly one day, this man
was sent to accompany him about the park to point
out the various improvements. The Emperor was
much pleased with his intelligent conversation, but
presently noticed that he began to be very uneasy
and even looked at the time, which was not considered
proper in the presence of the sovereign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, young man?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Your Majesty,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;this is
my first year of volunteer service, in the First Regiment
of Guards, and my captain is very strict. I
am due at the barracks in three-quarters of an hour,
and it is impossible for me to get there now except
with the utmost haste. I shall be late unless Your
Majesty will be so gracious as to release me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>Much pleased with his gardener&rsquo;s punctuality,
the Emperor sent him to don his uniform with all
speed and ordered his carriage to be brought around
immediately. Then motioning to the grenadier to
take the seat beside him, they set off for the town
with a gallop. The company was already in line as
the carriage drew up at the barracks, but the Emperor
spoke to the captain in person, explaining
that it was his fault that the man was late and asking
that he should not be punished.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Still another instance of King William&rsquo;s unfailing
kindness and consideration to all classes is shown in
the following incident. At a grand review held on
the field of Tempelhof, the Emperor&rsquo;s sharp eyes suddenly
discovered a sergeant-major who could scarcely
stand upright and whose deathly pallor betrayed
either serious illness or some violent emotion. He
rode up at once to the man and asked what ailed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is nothing, Your Majesty, I am better already,&rdquo;
was the answer; but the tears in the eyes
of the bearded soldier belied his words. The Emperor&rsquo;s
gaze rested on his pale face with fatherly
kindness and he said encouragingly,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do not try to conceal anything from me, sergeant;
you too wear the Iron Cross, so we are
brothers in arms, and comrades should have no
secrets from each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unable to resist this exhortation, the sergeant
responded,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, Your Majesty, just now as we were marching
out here, my only child, a promising boy of six,
was run over by a wagon, and I do not know what
has become of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Emperor immediately sent an adjutant to
appropriate one of the near-by conveyances occupied
by spectators for the use of the sergeant, whom
he excused for the rest of the day, and the anxious
father with tears of gratitude in his eyes hastened
home to his family.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>A touching trait of the Emperor&rsquo;s character is
shown in his habit of making the rounds of the hospitals
in time of war to assure himself personally
that his wounded subjects were receiving the necessary
care, and cheer them with a kindly word of
encouragement or some slight gift. In the bloody
year of 1866 the Woman&rsquo;s Aid Society built a private
hospital in Berlin, which King William frequently
honored with his presence. Among the
patients was a musketeer who had lost his left arm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; said this man one day to the
King, &ldquo;I am twenty-four years old to-day. To
have had the happiness of seeing the King on my
birthday&mdash;I shall never forget it, sire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor shall I, my brave fellow,&rdquo; replied the King,
giving his hand to the soldier, who kissed it with
deep emotion. The King passed on from bed to
bed, but just as he was about to leave he said to his
suite, &ldquo;I must see that man again whose birthday
it is,&rdquo; and returning to the musketeer&rsquo;s cot he talked
with him for some time. That night, after the invalid
was asleep and dreaming of his sovereign, one
of the royal huntsmen appeared with a gold watch
and chain, sent by the King as a remembrance of
the day. The lucky man was often asked where
he got this fine watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess!&rdquo; he would always say, and after the
inquisitive questioner had tried in vain to solve
the riddle, he would shout with a beaming face:
&ldquo;It is from my King, my good King William!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Once while the King was visiting the hospital at
Versailles with the Crown Prince and several of his
generals, they came to the cot of a Silesian militiaman
who had had his right leg amputated and been
shot in the right shoulder also. When asked what
his injuries were, he replied:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have lost my right leg, Your Majesty, which
troubles me much, for now I shall not be able to
go on to Paris with the rest of the army. And
besides that the churls have shot me here in the
shoulder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every one laughed, and the King said: &ldquo;Cheer
up, my son! You shall have a new leg and enter
Paris with us yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be, sire,&rdquo; declared the simple-hearted
Silesian, &ldquo;but I can never win the Iron Cross now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again there was a laugh; but the Crown Prince
laid his hand on the brave fellow&rsquo;s head, saying,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have that too, my man,&rdquo; and the
King quietly nodded assent and passed on, his
eyes moist with tears.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>On another cot at this same hospital lay a pale
young infantryman. The physician had given him
a sleeping potion which had brought temporary
forgetfulness of his sufferings. As the Emperor
stood quietly looking down at him, his eye fell on
an album which the invalid had evidently been
reading when sleep overtook him. He picked it
up and wrote in pencil on one of the pages, &ldquo;My
son, always remember your King,&rdquo; then laid it back
on the bed and passed on. When the wounded man
awoke and found his sovereign&rsquo;s greeting, tears of
joy streamed down his cheeks and he pressed the
precious writing to his lips, sobbing. On the Emperor&rsquo;s
next visit he saw, by the deathly pallor
of the wounded infantryman, that death was near
and the poor fellow was past all aid or comfort. But
the soul had not yet left the body, a gleam of consciousness
still lingered in the fast-glazing eyes, and
he recognized the Emperor standing beside him.
The half-closed eyelids opened wide, and with a
last supreme effort the dying man lifted himself
and cried out,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will remember Your Majesty, even up
above!&rdquo; then fell back lifeless on his cot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; murmured the Emperor, and he gently
closed the eyes of the young hero who had died so
true a soldier&rsquo;s death.</p>

<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">Chapter X</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Family Life of the Emperor</span></h2>
<p>We have already had glimpses of Emperor
William&rsquo;s domestic affairs at the time
of his marriage and when the birth and
education of their children brought new
duties to the august parents. After the wars were
over and our hero had more time and opportunity
to enjoy the pleasures of home, he took the greatest
delight in his grandchildren, the sons and daughters
of the Crown Prince. Of these his special favorite
was the eldest, who in turn had the greatest affection
and reverence for his grandfather. In this Prince
Frederick William&mdash;or William, as he was called
after reaching his majority, by the Emperor&rsquo;s express
command&mdash;the latter beheld the future heir
to the throne, and watched over his education, therefore,
with the greatest care; inculcating in him,
above all things, the true German spirit of devotion
to the Fatherland, a deep appreciation of the army,
which had been so largely his own creation, and
lastly a boundless faith in that Providence which
had so often proved his best help in time of need.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>On the ninth of February, 1877, he placed his
grandson in the First Regiment of Foot Guards.
&ldquo;Now go on and do your duty!&rdquo; was the conclusion
of his address to the Prince on that occasion,
and these few words expressed the ruling purpose
of his own life,&mdash;a career that offered such a noble
example to the young soldiers. Without fear or
hesitation he had always done his duty faithfully,
and thereby won fame and greatness for his house,
his people, and all Germany.</p>
<p>His grandfather&rsquo;s injunctions proved a powerful
incentive to Prince William. A true Hohenzollern
from head to heel, he has devoted himself heart
and soul to the army, following in the footsteps of
the two heroic figures that were so near and dear
to him. Both father and grandfather watched with
deepest pride and interest the quick advancement
of the young officer, whose military career must
often have reminded the Emperor of his own
youth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>It was a great satisfaction to the aged monarch
that he was spared to witness his favorite&rsquo;s marriage
to the charming Princess Augusta Victoria of
Schleswig-Holstein, which took place February 27,
1881; and still greater was his happiness when on
May 6, 1882, a son was born to the young couple.
This was God&rsquo;s crowning mercy! Four generations,&mdash;the
patriarch whose eighty-five years had
indeed bleached his hair and furrowed his brow,
but with bodily and mental vigor still unimpaired;
the noble grandfather, a magnificent figure in the
nation&rsquo;s history, sound of heart and ripe in experience;
the young father, in the first flush of manly
vigor, with a long and brilliant future before him;
and last, the infant son, grandson, and great-grandson
just opening his eyes to a conscious existence.
It is not hard to understand the feeling of exultation
in which, at news of the happy event, the Emperor
shouted, &ldquo;Hurrah! four Kings!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>But, alas! this bright promise of a smiling future
was soon to be darkened by a cloud so thick and
heavy that it threatened to overwhelm the stanch
old hero who had stood fast through so many of
the storms of life. Early in the year 1887 symptoms
of an alarming throat trouble began to show
themselves in the Crown Prince. At first it was
considered merely an obstinate attack of hoarseness,
but it soon became evident that a much worse and
more dangerous malady was to be reckoned with.
All that was within human power and skill to accomplish
was resorted to. The most celebrated
authorities on diseases of the throat were consulted,
the most healthful resorts of Europe tried, but in
vain. All possible measures for relief were powerless.
The whole country was grief-stricken, nor
was the public sorrow confined to Germany alone.
All seemed to see the noble figure of the Crown
Prince shouting to his men at K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz, &ldquo;Forward,
in God&rsquo;s name, or all is lost!&rdquo; or leading his
army from victory to victory in the war with France,
and now stricken with an insidious disease that
slowly but surely sapped away his life. Nor did
they feel less for the afflicted father, waiting anxiously
for news from San Remo of his beloved son
and heir. It was indeed a dark shadow on our
hero&rsquo;s otherwise bright evening of life!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>In these days the Emperor clung more fondly
than ever to his daughter, the Grand Duchess of
Baden, and her devoted husband. At least once a
year when visiting the springs at Ems or Gastein
he had always been in the habit of spending a few
days with them, and these visits were bright spots
in the old man&rsquo;s life. Here for a brief time he was
&ldquo;off duty&rdquo;; free from the daily burden and pressing
cares of state, among his loved ones, and surrounded
by that tender care that only a loving
daughter can bestow. He was always happy at
these times, chatting in his friendly way with great
and small, and rejoicing at any opportunity of
giving pleasure to others.</p>
<p>Once, soon after the war, when he was staying at
Ems, a bookseller there had his show window decorated
with pictures of the Emperor. As the latter
was passing the shop one day, he saw a crowd of
boys gathered about the window. Stepping up to
them he asked, &ldquo;What is here, children? What
do you like best of all these pretty things? Which
would you rather have? Tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys looked at him and at one another in confusion
and did not know what to answer, till at last
one lively urchin helped them out of their dilemma
by shouting, &ldquo;I will buy the German Emperor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; replied the Emperor, &ldquo;you shall all
have him. How many are there of you?&rdquo; He
counted the boys, then went into the shop and
bought a number of the pictures, which he distributed
among them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>Another favorite diversion of Emperor William
was hunting, and he often went in the fall or winter
to shoot at Letzlingen, Hubertsstock, or elsewhere.
Once at the Count von Stolberg-Wernigerode&rsquo;s, they
had had a successful day, and the Emperor had
distinguished himself, for he was an excellent
marksman. When the game was counted, it was
announced that the sovereign&rsquo;s share was twenty-eight,
whereat His Majesty smiled roguishly and
remarked to his companions:</p>
<p>&ldquo;These results remind me of the quotation
&lsquo;There are more things in heaven and earth than
are dreamt of in our philosophy&rsquo;&mdash;for is it not a
marvel that I should have shot twenty-eight pieces
of game and only fired twenty-five cartridges?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>All the Emperor&rsquo;s servants had the deepest respect
and affection for him, and with good reason,
for never was there a more kind and generous
master, continually making them presents and never
forgetting to bring back some little gift when he
went on a journey. His dependents were always
treated with the greatest kindness and indulgence
and never received a harsh word, yet they never
failed to feel that he was the master. One evening
he went to the Victoria Theatre alone, accompanied
only by the coachman and a <i>j&auml;ger</i>, the latter of
whom betook himself to a restaurant across the
street as soon as his master had alighted. Whether
the play did not please His Majesty, or what the
reason was, does not signify, but he left the theatre
again after about a quarter of an hour. The carriage
was there, but no <i>j&auml;ger</i>. The Emperor must wait.
At a sign from the coachman one of the theatre
attendants ran to fetch the delinquent, who, terrified,
began to stammer out excuses with trembling lips.
But the Emperor only remarked quietly, &ldquo;Why
make so much of the matter? You must often
have been obliged to wait for me, now for once I
have waited for you; so we are quits. Open the
carriage door for me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>At another time, when he was suffering from a
severe cold, his physician, Dr. von Lauer, had carefully
prepared, besides the necessary medicines, a
tea for use during the night to allay his cough, and
shown the attendant exactly how much of the liquid
should be warmed and given to the patient at each
coughing-spell. When he made his morning visit,
he was joyfully informed by the faithful old servant
that his master had had a quiet night. Much relieved,
the physician entered his patient&rsquo;s sleeping
chamber, but a glance at the worn face and another
at the empty teapot made him doubt the accuracy
of the information he had just received. The
Emperor answered the unspoken question himself,
however.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have coughed a great deal, doctor,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and slept but little&rdquo;; then added, in answer to
the physician&rsquo;s glance, &ldquo;I took the tea several times
but did not ring for my valet. The old man needs
his sleep, so I warmed the drink myself over the
spirit lamp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was this same old servant who once declared,
&ldquo;I have been for forty years with my royal master
and have yet to hear him give an order or speak a
harsh word. With His Majesty it is always &lsquo;Please&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; never anything else.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>This very regard and consideration for others
may have proved fatal to himself, for on the night
of March 3, 1888, when obliged to leave his bed
for a short time, instead of summoning his servant,
as Dr. von Lauer had repeatedly charged him
to do on such occasions, he let the old man sleep
and attempted to get up by himself; but a sudden
faintness seized him and he sank helpless on
the floor. By the time the valet had come to his
assistance the Emperor was chilled through and unable,
so says the Berlin &ldquo;Court Chronicle,&rdquo; to show
himself at the window the following day. He
begged the valet, however, to say nothing of this
to the physician.</p>
<p>Yet in spite of his leniency, the Emperor was
too thorough a soldier not to be a strict disciplinarian
also. His slightest nod was equivalent
to a command with his dependents, and a
reproof therefore was seldom necessary. If anything
went wrong he would merely say quietly,
&ldquo;That is not the way I care to have things
done,&rdquo; and this simple remark was more effective
than a string of oaths would have proved from
another. But if their royal master&rsquo;s admonition
was &ldquo;This shall not be done,&rdquo; then the whole
household trembled.</p>
<p>It was also characteristic of the Emperor that
he never remembered a fault or laid it up against
the offender. If the kindly expression gave
place to sternness for the time, it was never long
until his usual cheerful serenity returned; while
if he himself had erred or given an undeserved
rebuke, he was quick to acknowledge it and ask
pardon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>Once in the seventies, while staying at the grand-ducal
court of Schwerin, a visit had been planned
to the Court Theatre, at that time under the direction
of the Intendant Baron von Wolzogen, and
the Grand Duke had ordered a special armchair to
be placed in the royal box for the august guest. As
expected, the Emperor made his appearance that
evening at the theatre. It was devoted to light
comedy, of which he was especially fond; but as he
seated himself, sitting down somewhat heavily, as
was his custom, the chair that had been provided
for him gave way, and he found himself for a moment
on the floor, though fortunately unhurt. In
the audience the accident was scarcely noticed; but
to the Intendant, who anxiously hastened to the
box, His Majesty said shortly and coldly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In future, when you receive guests, see to it
that at least they are not given disabled chairs,&rdquo;
and turned quickly away without giving the mortified
Intendant any opportunity for excuses. As it
chanced, however, the providing of the chair had
not been intrusted to him, but to the Court Chamberlain.
During the next intermission, therefore,
the Emperor sent for the Intendant and greeted
him kindly with the words:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Baron, I did you an injustice just
now; my reprimand was directed to the wrong
address, as I have learned in the meantime. I am
sorry and wanted to tell you so this evening, so we
should both sleep the better.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Emperor&rsquo;s Death</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;The days of our years are threescore
and ten years; and if by reason of
strength they be fourscore, yet is their
strength labor and sorrow.&rdquo; So sings
the Psalmist, and thus it was with the life of Emperor
William,&mdash;a ceaseless round of toil and weariness,
of care and struggle, that reached its climax
in those astounding victories that strengthened the
throne of Prussia and brought about the unification
of Germany. Even in his old age he was not permitted
to end his days quietly, as we have seen, but
still devoted his whole time and strength to the
welfare of the Fatherland, nobly striving to maintain
peace both at home and abroad. He had lived
to see Germany a free and united Empire once
more, with a position among the nations of the earth
she had never before attained, and might well say
with Simeon, &ldquo;Lord, now lettest thou thy servant
depart in peace,&rdquo; were it not for the war clouds that
still hung about the horizon, and had the Crown
Prince stood beside him in all his old health and
vigor, ready to take the reins of government from
his hands. This was the great sorrow that clouded
his declining years and caused him painful anxiety
as to the future in view of his own death, which
could not now be far distant. The Emperor naturally
possessed a powerful constitution, strengthened
by the regular life he led and his freedom from early
excesses of all kinds. An occasional cold, or attack
of a painful but not at all serious ailment to which
he had been subject for many years, would confine
him to his room or bed for a short time, but except
for this he had enjoyed excellent health. But
having reached an age far beyond that usually allotted
to mortals, it was not strange that during his latter
years, whenever it was announced that His Majesty
was ill, the physicians&rsquo; daily reports were anxiously
awaited, or that when the aged monarch again appeared
at the familiar corner window of his palace he
was greeted with cheers by the assembled crowds,
while the solemn tones of the &ldquo;Heil Dir, im Siegerkranz,&rdquo;
swelled up into the sky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>It was on Friday, March 2, 1888, that the
Emperor drove out for the last time. There was
an icy north wind blowing in Berlin that day, and
he contracted a cold which, in his already somewhat
enfeebled health, he was unable to throw off. His
physical condition was aggravated, too, by anxiety
over the political situation and his son&rsquo;s illness; and
when in addition to this news was received of the
sudden death of a favorite grandson, Prince Louis
of Baden, the shock was too great for the old man
to recover from. On Monday, March 5, his condition
was far from encouraging, and on the following
day it became even more critical. A sleepless
night greatly reduced the patient&rsquo;s strength, and on
Thursday, toward evening, he sank into a death-like
stupor, from which, except for one or two brief
intervals of consciousness, he never rallied. At half-past
eight the following morning, March 9, the soul
of the aged hero, the father of the Fatherland, passed
quietly away into the land of eternal peace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>During the Emperor&rsquo;s last hours the members of
his family, together with some of the highest court
officials, were gathered round his bedside. On
Thursday afternoon, at the suggestion of Prince
William, the dying man was asked if he would like
to see the Court Chaplain, Dr. K&ouml;gel, and on his
assenting the divine was sent for. After a few words
of greeting to his royal master, in which he expressed
the sympathy of the whole people, he recited some
passages of Scripture, and at the sick man&rsquo;s request
a few verses of some of his favorite hymns, followed
by a prayer, the Emperor now and then
responding clearly, with an expression of satisfaction
or assent. From seven till ten o&rsquo;clock that evening
there seemed a marked improvement, during which
the august patient conversed cheerfully with Prince
William. The greater part of the family, feeling
much encouraged, permitted themselves a few hours
of sleep. Toward four o&rsquo;clock in the morning,
however, symptoms of collapse showed themselves.
He became unconscious again, and it was evident
that death was near. The family and watchers
were hastily summoned and Dr. K&ouml;gel again sent
for. He recited the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, Her Majesty
the Empress joining in, and then read the twenty-seventh
Psalm, beginning &ldquo;The Lord is my light
and my salvation.&rdquo; When he had finished, the
Grand Duchess of Baden, who had hastened to her
father&rsquo;s bedside at the first news of his illness,
leaned over and asked: &ldquo;Did you understand,
Papa?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>The Emperor answered clearly, &ldquo;It was beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She then asked: &ldquo;Do you know that Mamma is
sitting here beside you, holding your hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dying man&rsquo;s eyes opened and he looked long
at the Empress, then closed them for the last time.
His parting look was for her, but his last sigh for
the beloved son, stricken unto death and in a foreign
land, as was evident from the touching cry,
&ldquo;Alas, my poor Fritz!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When life was extinct, all present knelt while
Dr. K&ouml;gel offered a prayer, concluding with the
supplication, &ldquo;O Lord, have mercy on our royal
house, our people, and our country, and in the
death of the Emperor may Thy words be fulfilled,
&lsquo;I will bless thee, and thou shalt prove a blessing.&rsquo;
Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The excitement throughout the country at the
news of Emperor William&rsquo;s death was tremendous.
Bells were tolled from every church spire, flags
hung at half mast or were wrapped in crape, while
hundreds of sad-faced people wandered into the
churches to pray or seek comfort in the words of
the priests.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>The Emperor&rsquo;s deathbed</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>On the night of March 11 the earthly remains of
the deceased Emperor were taken from the palace
to the cathedral, where they were to lie in state. In
spite of a heavy wind and snowstorm the Unter
den Linden was so thronged with people that progress
was impossible, and the police had hard work
to keep the way clear, yet the most solemn stillness
prevailed. At five minutes before twelve the regular
tramp of marching troops was heard and torchbearers
were seen issuing from the palace. The soldiers
took their places, Colonel von Bredow with a
squadron of the body-guard being in charge of the
arrangements, and formed a solid wall on both sides
of the street from the palace to the cathedral, long
crape streamers falling from the plumes on their
helmets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>At midnight the bells of the cathedral began to
toll, and an hour later the head of the procession
appeared, advancing slowly between a double line
of torches, led by the first division of the body-guard
under Colonel von Bredow. Behind these
at some distance was a battalion of foot guards,
followed by all the Emperor&rsquo;s servants in a body,
including his own coachman, <i>j&auml;ger</i>, and valet. Then
came thirty non-commissioned officers with snow-white
plumes, bearing on their shoulders the coffin
of the deceased Emperor, covered with a plain
black pall. Immediately behind it rode the Crown
Prince and Prince Henry, followed by all the generals
and foreign military <i>attach&eacute;s</i>, among them
Count Moltke. Then another division of mounted
body-guards clattered by, and the procession ended
in a long line of carriages.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>The interior of the cathedral was an impressive
sight. The chancel had been converted into a
grove of palms and laurels, in the centre of which,
on a black catafalque, rested the casket of purple
velvet heavily decorated with gold. On either side
stood huge candelabra from which countless tapers
shed their soft radiance, while close beside were
placed white satin stools embroidered in gold. At
the foot of the coffin were laid the rarest and costliest
wreaths. After it had been lifted on to the
catafalque the Emperor&rsquo;s own valet, who had always
attended to His Majesty&rsquo;s personal wants during his
lifetime, approached and lifted the pall. Even in
death the monarch&rsquo;s features wore the same expression
of noble serenity that had characterized them
in life. Upon the venerable head was placed the
military forage cap. The body was clothed in the
uniform of the First Foot Guards, the historic gray
cloak drawn carefully about the shoulders. His
only decorations were the Star of the Order of the
Black Eagle, the collar of the Order of Merit, and
the Grand Cross of the Order of the Iron Cross. At
his feet lay a single wreath of green laurel. Keeping
watch on the right side of the bier stood two of the
palace guards with arms lowered, on the left two
artillerymen with raised arms, this honorary service
being shared in turn by all the guard regiments.
From this time until the day of the funeral the
cathedral became the centre of attraction, not only
to the people of Berlin but to the thousands of
strangers who thronged the capital anxious to obtain
one more last look at the beloved Emperor.
From early morning till far into the night a vast
multitude surrounded the cathedral, waiting and
hoping to gain entrance; but although an average
of seventy-five hundred people passed through the
edifice every hour, there were still hundreds left
outside, unable to gratify their desire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>Meanwhile Unter den Linden, through which
the funeral procession was to pass on its way to
the mausoleum at Charlottenburg, had been transformed
into a street of mourning. Art and patriotism
combined to achieve the highest results of
the decorator&rsquo;s skill, and the wide thoroughfare
presented an appearance of gloomy magnificence
impossible to describe here in detail. All the public
buildings were draped in black and elaborately decorated;
the streets were lined with Venetian masts
connected with festoons of black and surmounted
by the royal golden eagle, while many ornamental
structures of various kinds had been erected, some
enclosing statues of allegorical figures. The Brandenburg
Gate was most imposing, and well might it
be, for the sovereign who had entered it so often
as a conqueror was now to pass out of it for the
last time. All along the Siegesallee also were displayed
signs of mourning, while at Charlottenburg
the public grief found touching expression in the
crape-wreathed banners and sable-hung houses and
monuments.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>The funeral obsequies were held on Friday,
March 16. On the stroke of eleven the brazen
tongues of the cathedral bells gave the signal, which
was answered by those of all the churches in Berlin
tolling at intervals all during the ceremonies. At
the same time the doors of the cathedral were
opened; the various officers took their appointed
places at the head and foot of the coffin. The
Minister of State and the Lord Chamberlain stepped
behind the tabourets on which lay the imperial
insignia,&mdash;crown, sword, orb, sceptre, etc.,&mdash;the
generals and military deputies present grouping
themselves on the lower step of the estrade. The
invited guests, knights of the Black Eagle, members
of the diplomatic corps, heads of noble houses,
and others who had assembled in the outer part of
the church, were then shown to their places, and
last of all the Empress Victoria, Queen Elizabeth
of Roumania, and the royal princesses entered and
took the seats placed for them in a semicircle before
the altar, the other foreign princesses occupying an
enclosure to the left. The foreign ambassadors had
places reserved for them in the body of the church
immediately behind the most illustrious guests.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>The funeral services, which at the Emperor&rsquo;s
own request were conducted by the Court Chaplain,
Dr. K&ouml;gel, assisted by the cathedral clergy, began
shortly after noon. While the mourners were
assembling the organist had been playing soft
preludes into which Emperor William&rsquo;s favorite
tunes were skilfully woven, but when all had arrived
its deep tones died away and the service began with
the reading of portions of the ninetieth Psalm and
of the eleventh chapter of the Epistle of Saint John.
Then came the singing of &ldquo;I know that my Redeemer liveth&rdquo;
by the cathedral choir and the funeral
sermon by Dr. K&ouml;gel. He had chosen as his
text the verses from Saint Luke, &ldquo;Lord, now lettest
thou thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have
seen thy salvation,&rdquo; and the trembling tones of the
great preacher betrayed his deep emotion as he
spoke of the dead monarch, to whom, as spiritual
adviser, he had stood so close. After a short prayer,
followed by other selections from the choir, the
congregation joined in singing a hymn, and the service
concluded with the pronouncing of a benediction
over the departed Emperor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>It was a quarter before two when a salvo of
artillery announced that the funeral procession was
about to start. First came a squad of mounted
police trotting briskly through the centre of the
Linden, followed in a moment by another. Then
through the cold snow-laden air sounded the strains
of Beethoven&rsquo;s Funeral March and the trumpeters
of the First Hussars appeared on their white horses,
leading the musicians. In seemingly endless array
followed squadrons of the First and Second Dragoons,
the First, Second, and Third Uhlans, the
body-guard in their gorgeous uniforms, and cuirassiers;
then six battalions of infantry and regiment
after regiment of artillery, all with crape-wound
banners and muffled drums. The mournful strains
of the funeral marches with the slow tramp of the
marching columns was unspeakably melancholy and
impressive in its effect, and the vast throng of spectators,
held back by a barrier formed of seventeen
thousand members of Berlin guilds and societies,
stood in awed silence, not a voice raised or a sign
of impatience visible all during the hour that the
procession required in passing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>Behind the troops, at a short distance, came a
group of twelve divines headed by Dr. K&ouml;gel; then
a long line of court officials, gentlemen-in-waiting,
and pages, their brilliant costumes forming a startling
contrast to the prevailing gloom. Following
these, and uniformed in accordance with their military
rank, were the Emperor&rsquo;s two physicians, Dr.
Leutbold and Dr. Tiemann, Dr. von Lauer having
been kept away by illness. The gorgeously embroidered
uniforms of the chamberlains and gentlemen
of the bedchamber next appeared, and behind
them the ministers, bearing the imperial insignia
on purple velvet cushions, preceded by four marshals
whose hereditary titles recalled the days of
Germany&rsquo;s ancient splendor,&mdash;the Lord High Cup
Bearer Prince Hatzfeld, the Grand Master of the
Hunt Prince Pless, the Grand Master of the Kitchens
Prince Putbus, and the Lord High Marshal
Prince Salm.</p>
<p>Then came the imperial hearse, a sort of catafalque
on wheels, drawn by eight horses, each led
by a staff officer, and over it a yellow silk canopy
adorned with the eagle and emblems of mourning,
supported by twelve major-generals. The ends
of the purple velvet pall that covered the bier
were held by Generals von Blumenthal, von der
Goltz, von Treskow, and von Oberwitz, and on
either side of it walked the twelve officers who
served as pallbearers. Immediately following the
hearse was the deceased Emperor&rsquo;s favorite saddle
horse, with bridle and housings of black, led by an
equerry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>And now appeared an array of princes and dignitaries
such as the world has seldom seen assembled.
General Pape, flanked by Count Lehndorff and
Prince Radziwill, bore the imperial standard in advance
of the Crown Prince William, who walked
alone, wrapped in a military cloak and deeply affected.
About five paces behind him followed the
Kings of Saxony, Belgium, and Roumania, then
Princes Henry, Leopold, George, and Alexander
with the Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Meiningen, and
after them fully a hundred illustrious mourners
walking four, six, and even eight abreast, Russian
grand dukes, Austrian archdukes, royal representatives
from Italy, England, Portugal, Spain,
Greece, Denmark,&mdash;princes from all the sovereign
houses of Europe, reigning or deposed, envoys
and deputies from every State and Republic in the
world.</p>
<p>But there was no attempt at display; enveloped
for the most part in cloaks and furs they quietly
and humbly followed the earthly remains of him
who in life had been the greatest of them all, and
behind them came the military deputies of foreign
powers,&mdash;generals from France, pashas from the
Golden Horn, princes from the north and the
south, even the venerable Cardinal Galimberti,
representing Pope Leo Thirteen. Conspicuous by
their absence from this assembly, however, were
the two pillars of the Empire, Prince Bismarck and
Count von Moltke, whom the inclement weather
and their state of health had kept at home. Following
these personages was a vast number of
mourners of all ranks, while two battalions of infantry
brought up the rear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>On arriving at the Siegesallee, the procession
halted while the princes and dignitaries walking
behind the bier entered the equipages that were
waiting to convey them to Charlottenburg, and
the royal insignia was taken back to the palace
in Berlin by eight officers under escort of the
bodyguard. The cortege then resumed its march
to Charlottenburg, where from the window of
the palace the Emperor Frederick watched with
streaming eyes his beloved father&rsquo;s last royal
progress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>At the Luisenplatz another halt was made to
permit the mourners to descend from the carriages
and escort the remains to the mausoleum, where
the Emperor&rsquo;s own company of the First Foot
Guards was waiting to receive them. The coffin was
borne in and placed temporarily between the two
stone slabs that mark the resting place of Frederick
William Third &ldquo;The Just,&rdquo; as he was called by
his people, and his wife, Queen Louise of blessed
memory. The court chaplain offered a short
prayer, a parting salute of a hundred and one guns
was fired, and the last solemn rites were ended.
Under the cypress boughs that shade the national
sanctuary, at the feet of the parents he had honored
all his life with so childlike a devotion, the remains
of the heroic sovereign were laid to their eternal
rest.</p>
